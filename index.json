	"content": "Zoom Breakout Room 1: Measurement of Encrypted DNS  Kick-off question from Sandra: Who are we designing encrypted DNS protocols for?  Idea from Benno (who couldn\u0026rsquo;t be present in the session): these protocols need to be designed to work for everybody. Alec: I don\u0026rsquo;t think \u0026ldquo;designing for everybody\u0026rdquo; would go well. DNS is a distributed protocol; it is a distributed database. It is very presumpuous of us to designate threat models onto third parties. Telling users how much privacy they are allowed to have (i.e., the security/privacy properties of encrypted DNS protocols) will inevitable have consequences. It may drive them underground. Sandra: I agree, but most people don\u0026rsquo;t know what DNS is, nor DoT/DoH. They don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know what decisions to make. Paul: Historically, the IETF has been pretty bad at predicting user behavior. The development of the Internet in general has shown that every new protocol has been bent (and that may be one of the charms of the Internet!) There\u0026rsquo;s clearly a need for better education. The best we can do right now is \u0026ldquo;turn loose\u0026rdquo; a bunch of stuff (e.g., protocols) and see what sticks. Paras: Until now, every presentation I\u0026rsquo;ve heard on encrypted DNS has been about how to get the lowest latency. Alec, I like that your presentation doesn\u0026rsquo;t just focus on getting the lowest latency, but rather something that\u0026rsquo;s acceptable. However, I have kids in my house, and they\u0026rsquo;re really impatient. If I ask my 13 y/o, they just want the fastest protocol; they\u0026rsquo;re not as concerned about privacy. Thus, the decisions we make about protocols and tradeoffs between latency/privacy are very individualistic. Alec: In my experience, waiting for Netflix with DoHoT is not too bad. It\u0026rsquo;s no worse than using 4G in a well-served area. Occasionally, you go through days where there\u0026rsquo;s extra latency for a brand new domain name that isn\u0026rsquo;t cached, but otherwise that\u0026rsquo;s lost in the noise. I can\u0026rsquo;t speak for your kid, but I\u0026rsquo;m just happy to make something that just works. I want to make the point that latency is a budget, not a cost. Simone: Because of my work with OONI, I spend a lot of time speaking with users not in the West. I am humbled by the amount of information these people have about censorship, and how to circumvent it, e.g. with DoT/DoH/VPNs. They know this out of necessity. I believe that on the one hand saying that users are \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo; is true to an extent, but we have to qualify this statement. Increasingly, this is not becoming the case. Who am I designing for: everyone where \u0026ldquo;everyone\u0026rdquo; means people that have difficulties using it. I would encourage us to design stuff that considers everyone in the world. Sudheesh: I did not mean to say that users are \u0026ldquo;dumb.\u0026rdquo; I agree with the idea that latency and performance are not everything. There are a huge number of people that don\u0026rsquo;t even have cellular connectivity. However, we can\u0026rsquo;t neglect the idea that latency and performance matter. The goal should be to drive down latency while increasing connectivity and increasing security/privacy. Alec: Imagine you worked for a really large social network. They have to deal with the fact that people have satellite links, and people are joining the network from less well-connected networks. You may want to build caches that are close to these users. Why not, then, address the question of making DNS fast for everyone by having a \u0026ldquo;local\u0026rdquo; version of ODoH (or DoHoT) that works in local networks, rather than a centralized solution?

However numerous challenges remain, including:\n The path to encryption of DNS by default, both for stub to recursive and recursive to authoritative Transparency of operator management of DNS data. Blocking of newer encryption technologies, including DoT and DoH, in certain environments (from local networks to nation state level) User engagement and understanding of ‘Encrypted DNS’  This workshop will allow participants to contribute to the accelerating progress of DNS privacy technologies and deployment throughout the Internet. We aim to bring together a quorum to discuss these technologies, both established and emerging. One special focus will be the contributions that DNS privacy makes in civil society applications, in conjunction with related and newer technology such as Encrypted Client Hello.\nCall for Submissions We welcome submissions in the form of research papers, short papers, or draft presentations concerning all aspects of the threats, the protocols, and future design spaces of DNS privacy or the privacy of adjacent protocols. Usability, traceability, measurement and analytical evaluations are particularly encouraged. Research papers may also cover the equivalent privacy topics concerning domain name metadata of other infrastructure protocols such as WebPKI, DHCP, DIAMETER, etc. where the authors are willing to discuss the interrelation of these other protocols with DNS in the infrastructure. Submissions should address impacts and effectiveness of DNS Privacy in the context of usable privacy and/or civil society. Potential Topics  Measurements of DoT and DoH (if previously published, updates on results are welcome)  Encrypted Client Hello (ECH): DNS privacy aspects of DNS SVCB and HTTPS  DNS Zone Transfer over TLS (XoT) DNS privacy and censorship circumvention Real-world deployments of DNS Privacy technologies DNS privacy operator best practices and experiences Traffic analysis of DNS encryption Privacy versus DNS consolidation Realtime privacy inspectors such such as Project Blacklight and DNS privacy  Privacy implications of DNS over QUIC Evolving threat model  Submission and Proceedings Details Submissions will not be anonymous.\nTypes of submission:\n Previously published paper - with a 2 page cover letter describing how the presentation will be updated or focused for the workshop.

We report our initial results below.\nInitial work The goal of the first phase of work it to get a general understanding of the characteristics of the behaviour of several open source recursive implemetnations under TCP and TLS load. The first measurements look at 2 aspects:\n How does TCP and TLS compare to UDP for a very small number of client connections (1-16) For a small number of connections how does performance vary with the number of queries per connection  We concentrate on relative performance rather than absolute values.\nResults and configuration files can be found in the Performance Testing git repo.\nWe also presented this work at RIPE 76: Slides, Video\nFurther follow up work can be found here: Follow-up Performance Measurements (Q4 2108)\n Nameservers We tested four nameservers:\n Bind 9.12.1 (does not support TLS) Unbound 1.7.0 Knot Resolver 2.3.0 dnsdist 1.3.0  Test setup Software We have used the well known dnsperf from Nominum (now owned by Akamai) for the basis of our testing.  dnsperf: For UDP measurements to original tool from Nominum was used dnsperf-tcp: For TCP measurements we used a fork from dnsperf with added TCP support. The code is available on github. (This work was funded by a grant from NLnet Foundation). dnsperf-tls: For TLS we had to re-factor dnsperf-tcp somewhat to accommodate TLS support. We implemented this with both OpenSSL and GnuTLS but saw no difference if performance of dnsperf and so we used the version with OpenSSL (TLS 1.2) for the tests below. This code is also available on github. We do note that we see some reduced performance for this version when using TCP and TLS at very low queries per connection (we believe due to limitations in the implementation because of how the dnsperf threading model interacts with TLS read/writes).   For future work we would like to create a bespoke testing tool designed to specifically handle TCP and TLS. We have started a review of existing testing tools here.\nWe control the test runs from Jenkins and the scripts use a mix of bash, awk and GNUplot to automatically generate plots of the results. Test parameters The results are the averages of 5 repeated runs each of 20 seconds with dnsperf set to allow a total of 5000 outstanding queries. We note that with a smaller number of outstanding queries we see quite different results and above this number we see no differences. Hardware Our current set up simply consists of one client machine and one nameserver machine connected via a 10Gb switch:\n  The servers are both Supermicro Super Servers with a X10DRW-iT Motherboard running BIOS v2.0b. Each has 2 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 v4 @ 2.10GHz with 8 cores (16 threads).\n  They have an Intel Corporation 82574L Gigabit Network Connection used for management and a dual port Intel Corporation Ethernet Controller 10-Gigabit X540-AT2 for load testing. The two 10Gb interfaces are connected to a Netgear M4300-8X8F 10Gb switch.\n  The servers are running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\n  The 10Gb ethernet controller (ixgbe) drivers have been upgraded to the latest from Intel https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/14687/?product=60020 version 5.3.3.\n  See below for sample results on 18.04 without the spectre/meltdown fixes and 16.04.\nOS tuning Only minimal OS tuning was performed in these first tests:\n The number of file descriptors was raised by adding the following to /etc/security/limits.conf  * soft nofile 100000 * soft nofile 100000  The following TCP TIME_WAIT and ephemeral port range changes were made  sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=20 sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1 sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range=\u0026#34;1025 65535\u0026#34; Nameserver configuration The nameserver test machine is also is set up with NSD acting as a root server that is able to answer all the questions in the queryfile-example-current from Nominum. At the start of each test run the recursive server cache was populated buy running the test queries against the nameserver which was configured to fetch the answers from the NSD instance. The configurations used for each nameserver are available in the git repo.\nIn each case the nameserver was locked to four cores to ensure the client could saturate the nameserver. For Unbound, Knot resolver and BIND the nameserver was configured to use 4 threads. dnsdist was configured with 4 listeners and it should be noted that for TCP it uses a different threading model where it spawns a separate thread for each TCP connection it handles (creating them as required) so this most probably explains the different behaviour of dnsdist observed below.\nResults The test results and a full set of plots can be found in the git repo.\nIncreasing load In the first test runs UDP, TCP and TLS were used to load the nameserver as the number of dnsperf clients were increased from 1 to 16. For TCP /TLS 20,000 queries per connection were sent so this is simulating persistent connections to measure the throughput of TCP/TLS connections. UDP only We note that Unbound and dnsdist have the best performance here and BIND and Knot Resolver have lower UPD performance. It is interesting to note how flat the performance of BIND is compared to the other nameservers.\nUDP vs TCP The surprising finding here is that with these specific test conditions dnsdist shows much better TCP performance the UDP performance. But as noted above it uses a very different threading model to the other nameservers. The other nameservers all show a roughly similar decrease in throughput over TCP of around 50%.\nNote that Unbound serially processes the TCP queries on a connection (i.e. it processes and sends a response to a TCP query before processing the next query on the connection) instead of processing queries concurrently (as specified in RFC7766). Work is in progress to change this behaviour. TCP vs TLS (BIND does not support TLS yet). As expected there is a drop in performance for TLS compared to TCP, of roughly 20-30%. TCP and TLS as a percentage of UDP The plot below show the TCP/TLS performance as a percentage of the UDP performance of the nameserver for loading with 8 clients (20,000 queries per connection for TCP/TLS). Whilst dnsdist show the best TCP performance, the relative drop in performance for TLS compared to TCP is significant.\nUnbound has the lowest TCP/TLS performance due to the lack of concurrent processing, whereas BIND and Knot have comparable UDP vs TCP performance. Vary queries per connection Less than 60,000 queries per connection Most of the nameservers show steady performance above 10,000 q/conn as would be expected.\nLess than 10,000 queries per connection dnsdist has a relatively smooth decline in performance in this range, Unbound and BIND are much flatter and decline only below ~1500 q/con. It is noted that Knot appears very flat for TCP until much lower q/conn (but not for TLS - we think this is due to limitations in our test tool and are investigating).\nLess than 500 queries per connection By examining the region below 500 in detail we see a marked difference for Knot Resolver compared to the other nameservers. Unfortunately our current test configuration encounters issues at low numbers of q/con so we don\u0026rsquo;t have numbers for below 60q/con. We are actively working to resolve this and extend these plots. The plot below includes a purely theoretical extrapolation of Knot resolver performance if amortization of the TCP handshake is the only factor that degrades performance (handshakes are amortized at (N+1)/N where N is the number of queries per connection).\nKey conclusions  Typically saw TCP was 40-50% of UDP throughput (except dnsdist, which uses a different threading model and performed better) TLS was 30-40% of UDP throughput Varying the number of queries per connection (including low numbers) shows amortisation of setup occurs between 100 or ~2000 q/conn depending on the nameserver  TODO list We clearly have more work to do to further investigate the behaviour we seen This includes:\n Drill to lower q/conn for TCP and TLS Dig into implementations…. Experiment with OS and nameserver tuning Add more options: TFO, TLS Session Resumption, TLS 1.3,… Compare to TLS proxy e.g. nginx, haproxy Add concurrent processing to Unbound Scale to MANY clients  Use new/different test tool?  Comments on test stability We do note that we see variations of the order of 10-15% when performing identical test runs on the same setup at different times (e.g. on following days with not change to the setup).\nSo each of the the data sets for a given setup is from sequential runs of the test suite for each nameserver for better comparison.\n"

	"content": " Background DNS setup  CNAMES   Configure dehydrated  Create a domains file Write a hook script   Write a script to download the certificates to your DNS servers    Background At Sinodun we use dehydrated https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated to manage our certificates. Also we use the dns-01 challenge to renew them.\nSince we run multiple DNS-over-TLS servers, the method used here employs a single \u0026lsquo;certificate management\u0026rsquo; server to renew the certificates, update the zone with the dns-01 challenge and make the renewed certificates available via ftp. A script is then run on each DNS server to download any new certificates using ftp to each server and restart the DNS service. In this example we use TLS proxies in front of BIND, or Knot resolver.\nDNS setup You could put the dns-01 challenge responses in your organisations main zone. However it is more flexible to dedicate a separate zone for that, especially if you are responsible for running the servers but someone else or some other organisation is responsible for the DNS.\nFor authoritative DNS we use knot https://www.knot-dns.cz/ because it has a nice interface for managing zones. The same effect could be obtained using dynamic updates.\nIt is a good idea to sign your zone if you are going to be putting challenge response records in it. However, the nameserver must be able to sign updates as they are applied.\nCNAMES Lets assume that we are managing certificates for two servers dnsovertls1.\u0026lt;YOURDOMAIN\u0026gt;. and dnsovertls.\u0026lt;YOURDOMAIN\u0026gt;.\nAdd CNAME RRs to the \u0026lt;YOURDOMAIN\u0026gt; zone like these. These will redirect queries for the dns-01 challenge to a dedicated zone which can exist on and be served by a dedicated certificate management server\n_acme-challenge.dnsovertls1.\u0026lt;YOURDOMAIN\u0026gt;. 300 CNAME dnsovertls1.\u0026lt;YOURDOMAIN\u0026gt;.acme.\u0026lt;YOURDOMAIN\u0026gt;. _acme-challenge.dnsovertls.\u0026lt;YOURDOMAIN\u0026gt;. 300 CNAME dnsovertls.\u0026lt;YOURDOMAIN\u0026gt;.acme.\u0026lt;YOURDOMAIN\u0026gt;. Delegate acme.\u0026lt;YOURDOMAIN\u0026gt; to the certificate management server by adding NS and DS RRs to the \u0026lt;YOURDOMAIN\u0026gt; zone. Lets assume the server is called ns1.acme.\u0026lt;YOURDOMAIN\u0026gt;\nCreate an empty zone for acme.\u0026lt;YOURDOMAIN\u0026gt; (SOA and NS and A/AAAA RRs).

Configuration It is recommended to use the default configuration file provided which will use \u0026lsquo;Strict\u0026rsquo; privacy mode and spread the DNS queries among several of the current DNS Privacy test servers. Note that this file contains both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. From 1.2.0 it is installed in /usr/local/etc/stubby/stubby.yml. For earlier versions a JSON like format was used - this is still supported but the file name must be specified on the command line using the -C flag. In versions prior to 1.1.3 the file was not installed automatically but can be manually copied to a convenient location by simply running something like:\n\u0026gt; sudo cp ../src/tools/stubby.yml /etc/stubby.yml More information on how to customise the configuration can be found here.\nRun Stubby from the command line Simply invoke Stubby on the command line.\n By default it runs in the foreground, the -g flag runs it in the background. The pid file is in /usr/local/var/run/stubby.pid by default or can the piddir can be specified on the configure using an configure option.)  \u0026gt; sudo stubby -l Logging The logging currently simply writes to stderr. In releases 1.2 and later runtime logging is controlled using the -l (enable full logging) and -v (choose logging level) flags.\n If you built with stub logging enabled (using the \u0026ndash;enable-stub-debug flag) but want to hide it use: 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 \u0026gt;/dev/null | grep 'STUBBY'  Stubby can also be run as a service - how to do this will depend on what distro you are using.\n Test Stubby A quick test can be done by using dig (or your favourite DNS tool) on the loopback address\n\u0026gt; dig @127.0.0.1 www.example.com Modify your upstream resolvers Once this change is made your DNS queries will be re-directed to Stubby and sent over TLS! (You may need to restart some applications to have them pick up the network settings).\n For Stubby to re-send outgoing DNS queries over TLS the recursive resolvers configured on your machine must be changed to send all the local queries to the loopback interface on which Stubby is listening. It might be useful to note your existing default nameservers before making this change!\n  On older systems just edit the /etc/resolv.conf file or on more modern systems update the DNS settings for your distribution e.g. systemd\n  Comment out the existing nameserver entries\n  Add the following (only add the IPv4 address if you don\u0026rsquo;t have IPv6)\nnameserver 127.0.0.1 nameserver ::1   You most likely need to restart the DNS resolver service\n  You can monitor the traffic using Wireshark watching on port 853.\nIf you encounter problems reverse this change to restore your default settings (no DNS Privacy).\n"

	"content": "\u0026lsquo;Stubby\u0026rsquo; is an application that acts as a local DNS Privacy stub resolver (using DNS-over-TLS). Stubby encrypts DNS queries sent from a client machine (desktop or laptop) to a DNS Privacy resolver increasing end user privacy.\nStubby is developed by the getdns project, has it\u0026rsquo;s own github repo and issue tracker but dnsprivacy.org currently hosts the online documentation for Stubby .\nFAQ   What is Stubby?\nANSWER: Stubby runs as a daemon on the local machine sending DNS queries to resolvers over an encrypted TLS connections providing increased privacy for the user. Passive observers on the network can therefore no longer see the DNS queries made by the client, which are normally send in clear text on the wire using UDP. DNS-over-TLS was recently standardised by the IETF in RFC7858. The DNS server the client connects to can also be authenticated if the correct information is configured in Stubby - this prevents active attacks where a client might be directed to a server controlled by an attacker.\n  How does it relate to getdns?\nANSWER: Stubby is developed by the getdns team. libgetdns is a dependancy for Stubby, the getdns library provides all the core functionality for DNS resolution done by Stubby so it is important to build against the latest version of getdns.   How is it different to DNSCrypt?\nANSWER: DNSCrypt is a method of authenticating communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and haven\u0026rsquo;t been tampered with (the messages are still sent over UDP). As a side effect it provides increased privacy because the DNS message content is encrypted. It is an open specification but it has not been standardized by the IETF. Stubby uses only DNS-over-TLS to provide privacy, it does not implement DNSCrypt.\n  Does Stubby offer both \u0026lsquo;Strict\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Opportunistic\u0026rsquo; usage profiles as described in RFC8310? What are the differences?\nANSWER: Yes, Stubby can work in both modes. In \u0026lsquo;Strict\u0026rsquo; mode authentication information (e.g. an authentication name or a SPKI pinset) MUST be provided for each nameserver and DNS queries will only be sent if Stubby can authenticate the namerserver using this information. This guarantees against a trivial MitM attack on the connection to the DNS Privacy nameserver. In \u0026lsquo;Opportunistic\u0026rsquo; mode Stubby will try to authenticate the nameserver if possible, but will settle for using an unauthenticated, encrypted connection. Or if none of the configured servers support DNS-over-TLS is will fallback to using clear text over UDP or TCP in order to provide DNS service. This is a less secure mode than \u0026lsquo;Strict\u0026rsquo; but means that Stubby can still resolver your DNS queries even if a DNS Privacy server is not available. See Configuring Stubby for more information.\n  What is the difference between using Stubby and using Unbound as a local forwarding resolver?\nANSWER: Unbound can be configured as a local forwarder using DNS-over-TLS to forward queries. However at the moment Unbound does not have all the TCP/TLC features that Stubby has for example, it cannot support \u0026lsquo;Strict\u0026rsquo; mode, it cannot pad queries to hide query size and it opens a separate connection for every DNS query (Stubby will re-use connections). However, Unbound is a mature and stable daemon and many people already use it as a local resolver. While there were some early issues the last few releases of Stubby have focussed on stability and security and have significantly improved the usability of Stubby. We also have plans to add a small cache to stubby! Note that some users choose to use the two together, unbound for caching and stubby for upstream TLS.\n  What TLS version and Cipher suites does Stubby use?\nANSWER: Stubby supports TLS v1.2. In \u0026lsquo;Strict\u0026rsquo; mode Stubby is limited to using the 4 Cipher Suites recommended in RFC7525, in Opportunistic mode is uses the default OpenSSL Cipher suites.\nThe 1.3.0 release of getdns will support TLS 1.3 when using OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later, so build Stubby against that if you want to try it out! It also has a configuration option to allow the user to specify the Cipher Suites to be used.\n  Does Stubby support IPv6?\nANSWER: Yes - it fully supports IPv6.\n  Does Stubby support DNSSEC?\nANSWER: Yes, stubby can be configured to be a local validating stub. Note that this can currently add an overhead to DNS resolution because a greater number of queries are required (this will be mitigated in a future release when a small cache will be added to stubby).\n  What version of OpenSSL does Stubby require?\nANSWER: Stubby requires OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later for all functionality to be available.\n  How does Stubby decide which upstreams to use when some are failing?\nANSWER: In the 1.3 release of getdns a number of criteria are used to determine when to \u0026lsquo;back-off\u0026rsquo; from an upstream server e.g. how many times a connection to the server is tried but failed, if the server can be authenticated successfully (in Strict mode), how many times the server closes down the TLS connect before stubby does, how many timeouts are received from the server. When a server fails it is retried at increasing intervals up to a period of one hour. Some of these parameters are configurable.   What if I don\u0026rsquo;t have a local certificate store to validate certificates (e.g. I\u0026rsquo;m running on a router with minimal TLS library install)?\nANSWER: Since the 1.4 release of getdns validation of self-signed certificates can be done using just a SPKI pinset. See Issue#46 and PR#371.\n  Contributors Many people have contributed to developing and testing Stubby including (but not limited to!):\n Allison Mankin  Willem Toroop  Sara Dickinson Joel Purra Melinda Shore The rest of the getdns team!

DNS Queries DNS Zone Transfers Overview of solutions  Client (stub) to recursive resolver Recursive discovery Recursive resolver to Authoritative server Zone transfer A note on SNI      The DNS is one of the most significant leaks of data about an individuals and an organisations activity on the Internet.\n Some of the issues in simple terms:\nDNS Queries   Almost every activity on the Internet starts with a DNS query (and often several). A key function of the DNS is to map human readable names (e.g. example.com) to IP addresses that computers need in order to connect to each other.   Those queries can reveal not only what websites an individual visits but also meta data about other services such as the domains of email contacts or chat services.   Whilst the data in the DNS is public, individual transactions made by an end user should not be public.\n  However DNS queries are sent in clear text (using UDP or TCP) which means passive eavesdroppers can observe all the DNS lookups performed.\n  The DNS is a globally distributed system that crosses international boundaries and often uses servers in many different countries in order to provide resilience.\n  It is well known that the NSA used the MORECOWBELL and QUANTUMDNS tools to perform covert monitoring, mass surveillance and hijacking of DNS traffic.\n  Some ISPs log DNS queries at the resolver and share this information with third-parties in ways not known or obvious to end users.   Some ISPs embed user information (e.g. a user id or MAC address) within DNS queries that go to the ISPs resolver in order to provide services such as Parental Filtering. This allows for fingerprinting of individual users.\n  Some CDNs embed user information (client subnets) in queries from resolvers to authoritative servers (to geo-locate end users). This allows for correlations of queries to particular subnets.\n  Note that even when using a VPN some VPNs will still leak your DNS queries by sending them unencrypted to your ISP. Use the nice tool from anonymyster.com to check is this is happening with your VPN!\n  An overview of the problems is given in this Tutorial: DNS Privacy Tutorial.\nFor an expert review of this topic recommended reading is DNS Privacy Considerations.\nDNS Zone Transfers DNS zone transfers are transmitted in clear text, which gives attackers the opportunity to collect the content of a zone by eavesdropping on network connections. The contents of the zone could include information such as names of persons used in names of hosts. Best practice is not to use personal information for domain names, but many such domain names exist. The contents of the zone could also include references to locations that allow inference about location information of the individuals associated with the zone\u0026rsquo;s organization. It could also include references to other organizations. Overview of solutions For a full discussion of the options available please see DNS Privacy - The Solutions.\nClient (stub) to recursive resolver The two most widely deployed solutions for stub to recursive resolution are DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTP; they both encrypt DNS data and prevent passive surveillance of network data revealing users' DNS queries. They can both allow users to validate the server they choose for their DNS service to make sure they are using a provider who has a good privacy policy for how they handle user data. But they do have some different protocol properties and in practice are being deployed in somewhat different ways at the moment. Neither of these are trivial changes in the way DNS works and encryption of all DNS queries by default will not happen overnight. A Best Current Practice document describing Recommendations for DNS Privacy Service Operators has been approved for publication. This covers both downstream and upstream protocol issues and data handling recommendations for Operators of recursive resolvers that offer an encrypted protocol. See DNS Privacy Clients, DNS Privacy Implementation Status, DNS Privacy Public Resolvers, DNS Privacy Test Servers for more information.\nRecursive discovery One significant challenge is around discovery of which transports a particular resolver supports and securely acquiring information required to connect and validate a particular resolver. The ADD working group in the IETF is currently working on a range of proposals around this issue\nRecursive resolver to Authoritative server The DPRIVE working group at the IETF has been working on requirements and solutions for that, if you are interested see the DPRIVE mailing list. Zone transfer A draft in the DPRIVE working group is proposing encrypting zone transfers using TLS: Zone Transfer over TLS (XoT)\nA note on SNI Unfortunately the Server Name Indicator header in HTTPS messages also reveals the name of the website contacted by the user so provides a similar leakage channel for web traffic as the DNS queries. However there is work underway in the TLS working group at IETF to encrypt the Client Hello including the SNI: TLS Encrypted Client Hello\n"

	"content": "Session 1: Measurement of Encrypted DNS Oblivious DNS over HTTPS (ODoH)  Plaintext, traditional DNS (Do53) is the most widely used variant of the DNS protocol (92% of traffic seen at 1.1.1.1) However, Do53 leaks information about user traffic on the network DoH encrypts stub-to-resolver traffic. However, resolver operators can still associate queries with clients, enabling them to profile clients There are a number of additional problems in DoH today: centralization, privacy by policy, and regulatory concerns Key goals of ODoH: address association of queries to clients, and privacy by policy Key insight of ODoH: de-couple client IP addresses from the DoH queries they issue ODoH protocol (simplified)  Client encrypts query name, wraps it in a DoH query and sends it to a proxy node, which terminates an HTTPS connection with the client The proxy node then forwards this query to a DoH resolver or Oblivious target on behalf of the client Once the proxy node receives the response, it sends the response back to the client   Important considerations  Clients need to choose proxy nodes and target resolvers that are not operated by the same entity Clients need to have some level of certainty that proxy nodes and target resolvers are not colluding   Proxy nodes can see client\u0026rsquo;s IP address, but not the contents of the query Target resolver can see query contents, but not the client\u0026rsquo;s IP address Performance measurement setup  Three public resolvers: 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, and 9.9.9.9 90 client stub resolvers, 10 per vantage point  7 Google Cloud datacenters in the western/central/eastern United States, 1 datacenter in Montreal, and 1 datacenter in San Paulo   Experiment: 21,000 DNS requests per day (15 per minute)   DNS response time measurements  Takeaway 1: important to choose low latency proxy/target resolver pair Takeaway 2: re-use connections  Connection re-use improves median DNS response time performance by 48%   Takeaway 3: co-location between proxy/target resolver results in better performance Takeaway 4: compared to DoH, average query response times increase by 100% without co-location, and 50% with co-location   In-browser measurements (page load times)  PLTs increase by ~20% compared to Do53 without co-location, and 13% with co-location    Measuring DoT/DoH Blocking Using OONI Probe  OONI is a platform for measuring Internet censorship. Measurements performed from more than 200 countries. The platform is collaborative in that users install a tool called OONI Probe to run measurements (desktop app, mobile app, CLI) Motivation for measuring DoT/DoH blocking  States are increasingly asserting their power of sections of the Internet that they control If I\u0026rsquo;m a user querying a domain name that I \u0026ldquo;should not be\u0026rdquo; with an ISP resolver, then I may not get the correct response DoT and DoH should help avoid this DNS-based censorship in theory, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to see whether or not DoT/DoH are getting blocked in practice   DNSCheck experiment  Step 1: Bootstrap a DoT/DoH service. If the resolver URL contains a domain name (not something like 127.0.0.1), resolve the domain name using the client\u0026rsquo;s system resolver, and see if you get an IP address or an NXDOMAIN. Add the result to the set of known IP addresses. Step 2: Lookups. For every IP address we discover (plus ones we knew from beginning), try to connect to this IP address, do TLS handshake. If everything is successful, send a query and record a reply.   Measurements  Dec 15th, 2020 - Jan 10th, 2021 123 DoT/DoH services measured. This presentation focuses on DoH over TCP only Used an experimental CLI client (miniooni) Presentation focuses on three vantage points: Kazakhstan (AS48716), Iran (AS197207), China (AS45090)   Main findings  dns.adquard.com resolved to 10.10.34.36 in IR Most endpoints fail or succeed with lookups consistently 1.1.1.1:853 and 1.0.0.1:853 were blocked and unblocked frequently in KZ  Same for 1.1.1.1:853 in IR   dot://dot-jp.blahdns.com was unblocked in CN around Jan 1st, 2021 [Presentation included success/failure rates by vantage point in a table]   In KZ, most blocked resolver was Cloudflare (91% DoT, 88% DoH) Most common cause of failure in KZ was timeout after TLS handskae Most common cause of failure in IR was timeout during TLS handshake Most common cause of failure in CN was TCP connection timeout SNI-based blocking occurred in KZ for DoH  cloudflare-dns.com: 99% failure via timeout after TLS handshake mozilla.cloudflare-dns.com: 100% success   Future work  Make DNSCheck available to all OONI Probe users, rather than just miniooni users Study DoH over QUIC blocking Study whether Encrypted Client Hello reduces blocking Study the fingerprints of popular TLS implementations    \u0026ldquo;No Port 53, Who Dis?\u0026quot;; a year of DNS over HTTPS over Tor  Alec and his partner have exclusively used DNS over HTTPS over Tor for over a year. It worked marvelously, and he forgot that he set it up. It\u0026rsquo;s a system that is meant to provide additional privacy guarantees to your DNS queries. Concern: latency is going to be terrible.  Median latency for Alec: 262 ms. Goes up to 464 ms if you disable caching. Some people live with worse performance, day-in, day-out.   Some people are willing to trade off latency for other values, e.g. privacy. Arguing about 5 ms vs. 50 ms vs 500 ms is an act of tech privilege. Minimum latency isn\u0026rsquo;t everything. If you accept this persepective, you may instead think about latency in terms of a budget. DoHoT was designed to address a privacy-invasive threat model based around actors who..  May surveil network links Block queries Tamper with queries Learn that my identity was/is associated with certain queries etc..   Traditional DNS (Do53) risks all of these threats. DoT, DoH, ODNS, ODoH risk some of these. DoHoT risks arguably none of these, unless Tor relays become severly compromised. Setup  Copy of dnscrypt-proxy configured as stub Presented to the LAN as a DHCP Do53 service Configured to make all resolution requests over Tor via SOCKS Used a load-balanced pool of public DoH servers   Takeaway: please stop thinking of latency as cost. Please consider it a budget to offer value.  Q/A / buffer time discussion   Oblivious DNS over HTTPS (ODoH)\n Q (Paul Hoffman): Who are the users of this protocol, given that it is a larger and more fragile protocol than Do53/DoT/DoH? Who would not trust their immediate upstream resolver to profile but would trust them to collude with their resolver?  A (Sudheesh Singanamalla): One way to ensure that entities don\u0026rsquo;t collude is to have some Mozilla-like organization that vets resolvers (logging resolvers, non-logging resolvers, etc) so that users can make informed decisions. A (Chris Wood): Anyone who is interested in adopting DoH also consider the resolver to be malicious. ODoH in a way fills in the gap that DoH left.   Q ([?]): How do you limit the metadata leakage of DoH, e.g. a rogue resolver wanting to associate clients with queries?  A (Sudheesh): If there was a rogue resolver that wanted to identify what the client was doing, they could send a unique IP address and see who connects to that IP address. However, that\u0026rsquo;s outside the security/privacy guarantees of the protocol itself.   Q ([?]): Would it be better to use proxy nodes in a round-robin fashion to limit any concerns related to associating a user (or set of users) with a proxy?  A (Sudheesh): This issue should not occur is many users are using a proxy. However, if there are very few users using a proxy, it could be indirectly possible to associate a proxy to a user.      Measuring DoT/DoH Blocking Using OONI Probe\n Q (Allison Mankin): Are you generally using TLS 1.2 for measurements? You mentioned TLS 1.3 specifically on one data point.  A: We manually ran some measurements with TLS 1.3 to see whether outcome changed, and it did not change the outcome.   Q (Sara Dickinson): Am I correct in thinking that you ran some measurements in India that produced slightly different results?  A: We did some measurements in India. IIRC, there was no blocking in India.   Q (Ulrich Wisser): There was so much blocking w/ Cloudflare. Is that because the IP is allocated from a research network?  A: QUIC for 1.1.1.1, which means it was possible to route to this address.   Q (Puneet S.): I represent Google DNS. It was surprising that 8.8.4.4 worked but 8.8.8.8 didn\u0026rsquo;t work. Do you have any thoughts on that?  A: Censorship is not consistent. Every network has its own set of rules.   Q ([?]): Did you only use one VPS in KZ? Is the blocking specific to certain ASes or country-wide?  A: In KZ, we used two networks. One was a VPN and another was a VPS, but we stopped measuring with the VPN because nothing seemed to be blocked. Thus, it was unclear whether or not the VPN was actually located in KZ. Anecdotally, the structure of blocking is centralized, though.      \u0026ldquo;No Port 53, Who Dis?\u0026quot;; a year of DNS over HTTPS over Tor\n Q (dkg): Can you characterize the typical workflow for people on the network that this was deployed on? When you say this is liveable, what does that mean? Presumably due to lockdown there\u0026rsquo;s not very many people in your house.  A: Domestic environment for me and my partner. They connect to DHCP who gives the IP address of the resolver. The resolver runs on a Raspberry Pi. Not sure whether you would roll this out in a coffee shop or have everyone run this on their laptop independently.   Q (Chris Wood): I want to drill in on the threat model. You\u0026rsquo;re assuming an NSA-inspired actor that can use endless compute to track down what a client is doing. However, this threat model doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to scale. If every client was using something like ODoH, do we think there is enough resources available to track down what every client is doing?  A: I\u0026rsquo;m skeptical of this, too. However, there is a waterhole attack for DoH/ODoH, in which you log everything, throw it into an Oracle bin, and perform an analysis when you need to.   Q (Paul Syverson): My understanding is that Tor browser does not currently support DoH. This raises a learning curve/usability issue. How steep of a learning curve do you think is setting up DoHoT, and are you working on this?  A: I am not working on this because it\u0026rsquo;s a home setup thing right now. It\u0026rsquo;s hardly like I\u0026rsquo;m investing in it right now. I greatly encourage people to work on this and experiment on their own accord. However, because we have something like DHCP which literally tells people which resolver to use, the only additional thing I had to do was setup a firewall to ensure that no Do53 queries get leaked. You could easily turn a DoHoT service into an appliance.      Misc questions\n Q (Paul Hoffman): It seems like everything discussed so far requires users to have a certain level of understanding about privacy/latency tradeoffs. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t that go against everything we know so far about users? Who are we designing these protocols for?  A (Alec Muffett): I\u0026rsquo;ll turn that around: are we designing protocols only for speed demons, or people who want to achieve some other goal? Some people use Tor browser because they want some level of privacy. They are willing to accept latency tradeoffs. I don\u0026rsquo;t see that as elitist or discriminatory; it is offering value for people that are trying to solve a particular issue. A (Sudheesh Singanamalla): It may seem like these protocols are designed for people who know exactly what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, but that\u0026rsquo;s how protocols like HTTPS came into place. Most people don\u0026rsquo;t even know that HTTPS is in place right now, due to the big push that was made by the [networking/privacy/security] community. I suspect something similar will happen with DNS. I don\u0026rsquo;t think users are dumb; they clearly know what they want and what they\u0026rsquo;re doing.      Session 2: Civil Society, Usability and DNS DNS Privacy Vs based on a paper\n  4 Goals: confront tensisons between privacy protest, tradeoffs between privacy and other considerarions, a lot of researches are needed.\n  Abstract:\n make DNS lookup more private for the user affects internet mearsurements DNS cencership    DNS privacy is a big win as a public interest. Two fondational docs: RFC 6973, RFC 8280.\n  Measurement:\n Public interest benefits: 1) knowlede of network perf and op are inportant 2) empower users as consumers, 3) monitor bad behacvious. However, it comes at the cost of user pvivacy and 2) M is harder when user data is private (e.g., DoT, DoH) The research question is Which resrarch methods will work and not work with private DNS. Does user choise have impact, e.g, DoT, DoH?    Consolidation\n public interest concern 1) eco detrimental 2) degrades quality of services 3) slows innovations 4) single points of failure 5) facilitates mass surveillance 6) complicates regulatory jurisdiction. But there is huge market like browsers to adopt private DNS and the early adopator have better business model The key question is does ubiquitous adoption of private DNS resolve consolidation?    Abuse\n public interest benefit: mitiagte abusive behavior and lemitigate restrictions at the content layer But more private, more hard to mitigate    Shutdowns\n public interest concern: internet shutdowns violate the rights to free expression, access to information, and assembly.

They don\u0026rsquo;t collect IP, they transfer IPs to geo location.  A: didn\u0026rsquo;t. but none of the provider listed in the slide had policy about data transfer. Although some providers said they no storage, they do have retention periods.    Talk 4:\n  Murtuza Jadliwala: I am assuming your study targets users who know what DNS is. A sizeable internet population doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what DNS is or what it does. So how representative these results will be of the entire Internet user population?\n A: didn\u0026rsquo;t assume people know DNS. The survey started with questions of DNS and encrypted DNS.    DKG: similar thing about HTTP and HTTPs consolidation?\n A : a paper about cwarling the DNS. but not awrare of paper HTTP and HTTPs consolidation.    Sandra Siby: additional info provider to users to make decision?\n A: not from specific provider, just text what is encrypted DNS, optunistic mode. A lot people chose to stay worring phone may not work if they change the mode.    Sudheesh Singanamalla: Super interesting work. Do you think there’s an interesting opportunity towards the education aspect of privacy to have some sort of a landing page like the ones during browser updates to show users some explanations of what their settings could mean and suggestions to switch any settings if necessary?\n A: firefox has a popups when it changed to DoH defult. An education page can be very helpful. The firefox changed the popups during the survey - added more information.    Session 3: Novel work, ADoT and Future Research Programmable In-Network Obfuscation of DNS Traffic Liang Wang about this in-progress paper Do53 traffic reveals sensitive information Encrypted DNS methods put trust in public DNS resolvers, use a strategy of keeping the IPs of the queriers away from the public DNS resolvers. One solution is to use proxy-based solutions such as Tor or ODNS - no party can see the query and the source IP at the same time. This adds some issues to the deployment - introduction of latency or performance bottleneck. Also, configuration and user effort may be needed - adds learning curve or possibility of error.\nSuggestion: programmable network, upload a policy about the source IP into it. It has good performance properties. Do not need to make it do all the encryption work - which it may have some limits for - convert the source IPv4 to an IPv6 address. Encrypt the IPv4 address in the IPv6 address. Do not need cooperation with clients etc.\nPINOT sits at border of IPv4 network. PINOT encrypts the source IP in each packet individually. After encryption, the source IPs are meaningless to parties outside the network.\nChallenges include limitations of the programmable switch in PINOT - need to not put a packet through the pipeline only once, otherwise this hits too hard on throughput and latency. Decided to use a crypto algorithm that allows for this restriction, two-round Evan-Mansour. Not as secure as AES, but it is hard to break, and they think it is sufficient for this application - see the paper for details. Using IPv6 to allow the ciphertext to be put into the packet - use in the source IP address. Can\u0026rsquo;t use another field due to routers modifying along path. PINOT stores the encryption keys only. It is stateless.\nReserved IPv6 prefix is used Deploy at multiple ingress and egress points in the network. DNS traffic can leave the network from any egress point. Good for connectionless protocols, but working on an approach to connection-oriented DNS. Extra layer of protection on the IP address without modifying anything else. PINOT: network operator can still inspect and filter DNS traffic because only the source is obscured for the operator. They tried it with 350+ public DNS resolvers that support IPv6 - they were fine with requesting A records from this IPv6.\nThey did find asymmetry but the performance was not affected by this. They also use PINOT to talk to public NTP and for a key-based source address encryption for third party scanners - keep the source addresses from these public or third parties\nQuestions \u0026ndash;\nPaul Syverson: Even if the acknowledged weaker encryption is sufficient for these purposes, there is a long history of such restricted security mechanisms resulting in insecurity via function creep. Why do you think that won\u0026rsquo;t happen here? And what would be the cost of using AES instead?\nA: the cost of using AES is very poor performance in the data plane, tradeoff between those Paul: have you got numbers of what the contribution of AES would be to be able to reason about the tradeoff? A: we didn\u0026rsquo;t build this, but there are calculations about AES in another paper from the group Chris Wood: What is the threat model here? Given that the network is generally considered untrusted, how could clients reasonably ensure they benefit from PINOT? A: Value-added service. Make the network trusted in this case.\nBenno Overeinder: you used P4 switches, but did you consider XDP or eBPF which is easier to deploy?\nA: Once the P4 network is deployed, no user involvement. Benno: could test the threat model and protocol with the other protocols.\nTalk offline Britta Hale: You state that you are using static, pre-installed keys. Considering that a proxy may be compromised or by oversight request have its keys given up, how do you propose your system maintaining or achieving security over time and at scale? A: it\u0026rsquo;s not a static key. We do not record the key - just for a short-term. Generate new ones Britta: doing negotiation of keys from previous? A: just random keys\nSudheesh Singanamalla: Is there a reason why in the campus network the communication between the end-host to PINOT switch isn’t necessarily secured (exception with DNSCrypt)? Does the organization (campus/enterprise) want to know DNS requests made by users locally within the network? A: we just want to show the usefulness of this potentially, but it\u0026rsquo;s not tied to the organization model particularly\nA Balanced DNS Information Protection Strategy Scott Hollenbeck speaking for Verisign as TLD and Root operator Points out the number of TLS vulnerabilities surfaced every year. For some operators, the tradeoff to add encryption to the DNS stacks may be too risky Client information is not sent from recursive servers to authoritatives but the full FQDN is sent. We believe that Qname minimization is the best for this. It significantly reduces the risk of exposure. Maybe the risk is reduced enough versus encrypting with ADoT We do think that SLD (second level DNS servers)have a good case to do encryption with recursives.\nBut note that there is potential for operational impact on both parties. We encourage measurement studies to understand the impacts Other minimization techniques - NXDOMAIN/query cut, aggressive NSEC caching Minimize when possible, encrypt when needed elsewhere\nQuestions\nJim Reid: IETF has multiple WGs tackling this work in isolation from each other, should we take a holistic approach to the IETF and maybe stop some of the work on encryption?\nA: the IETF has done a pretty good job that the various DNS WGs are sharing info. E.g. ADD and DPRIVE. IETF is traditionally challenged in operator involvement, need to get operators to this topic\nWes Hardaker: concern about things that aren\u0026rsquo;t sent on purpose, e.g. the keywords that turn into queries.\nA: Verisign does publish a lot of info about the traffic we see at the root servers\nPaul Hoffman: this is not an official statement from ICANN but I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that any root server or TLD operator shoud be prevented from offering better privacy with encryption. Let the operators decide themselves. In the absence of the resolvers adding the minmization features, it\u0026rsquo;s better to let the operators make their decision on this\nA: no disagreement. We take this decision very seriously. If you operate a TLD that isn\u0026rsquo;t as big as COM, \u0026ldquo;knock yourself out\u0026rdquo;\nAlec Muffett: what are the risks you see of not being able to see the traffic. He leans to instrumentation at the endpoints to make sure users are going to the right server etc. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t see this in the overall discussion. Is it part of the overall model A: just my opinion, I believe it is considered. Verisign blocks DOH on its corporate networks.\nArmor for the back half of the camel: Why confidentiality matters for recursive DNS traffic DKG - two humps of the camel are the Stub-to-Recursive and the Recursive-to-the-Authoritative Assumption of a network-based adversary (more or less powerful) - what we have \u0026ldquo;solved\u0026rdquo; with DOH and DOT, but of course raising other issues. Head of the camel - armor there still allows the adversary to see queries coming to recursive and leaving it. The recursive is acting as a steward of the end-user.\nTiming analysis/side-analysis all remain possible and the stewardship by the resolver operator should include protecting the back half of the camel Previous talk characterized this as traffic to root, TLDs etc. Important to ack how problematic SLD are. Ex. of the New Yorker article about the Trump campaign contacts with a Russian bank - it could be done with just recursive to authoritative. DNS queries were coming from two orgs for a domain that nobody else looked up. Very revealing to see that those two were talking to each other because nobody else was looking up the domain. Problems with misconfigurations - the minimizations are risky to deploy, a SLD may be unreachable with issues of minimization A network monitor may not be able to pick out and target an individual from traffic above recursive. Who was visiting a site such as disruptj20.org? Get the ISPs from the data, then push on the ISPs by legal or extra-legal means. An resolver would do well to encrypt the back half for this. What does it mean to the authoritative if they are not offering encryption to the resolvers. The clients of an authoritative - the domain operator vs. the users of the domain. Resolver operators are stewards of both below and above. When might someone look up OpenPGP key for DKG at aclu.org. If the authoritative server doesn\u0026rsquo;t encrypt this, they are leaking info about how often DKG gets encrypted email. Lots of other types of DNS info leaks info. Authoritative servers stewardship. All of the surveillance concerns raised earlier are also the precursors to censorship. You may not be able to modify responses, if DNSSEC in use, but you can block and deny service.\nAuthoritative servers can consider using authoritative. It still encrypts a bunch of traffic on the network. Still need to get the rest of this figured out. The latter is next-level and we need to learn from opportunistic and get to authenticated encrypted DNS by authoritatives eventually.\nQuestions:\nSara says the threat landscape is well covered in this talk. We had trouble getting DoT deployed. Firefox taking control of the client was the game-changer for all of the client-2-recursive. What first mover would drive authoritatives? A: I\u0026rsquo;m not sure the analogy is super-precise here. We did see DOT adoption on Android before Firefox. People who could be first movers? Someone like Cloudflare probing toward authoritatives? Some authoritatives may decide it\u0026rsquo;s a priority and then they probers will get some benefit. Room for a bunch of folks to be first movers in this space. If there are academics researchers looking at this, create a scorecard of the results from minimized or probed/opportunistically encrypted.\nGeoff Huston: do what extent to SVC queries add the potential “leakage” issue in terms of information leakage by a richer semantics of intention signalling? A: I wish I had a better metric of this. Another example is the ECH keying material. We need analysis of this topic.\nQ/A / buffer time discussion Go straight to breakouts now rather than buffer time questions\n **Thanks a lot to our notetakers, Han Zhang and Austin Hounsel! **\n"

	"content": "Thanks to funding from the Open Technology Fund we have continued work on some performance measurements for various DNS Privacy implementations. We report our new results below.\n Previous work Goals of this work Results - TCP vs UDP  Unbound measurements Knot Resolver and BIND dnsdist   Results - TLS proxy vs native TLS  HA-Proxy fronting Unbound   Limitations of these measurements  Real DNS traffic data HTTP-like client population modelling?      Previous work    Our initial work on performance measurements can be found here: Initial Performance Measurements (Q1 2018). This work was presented at RIPE 76: Slides, Video. Key results from this work were:\n Setup: Used modified dnsperf with UDP/TCP/TLS on 2 bare metal machines Comparisons of 4 nameservers for small number of clients (10s)  Typically saw TCP was 40-50% of UDP throughput (except dnsdist, which uses a different threading model and performed better) TLS was 30-40% of UDP throughput   Varying the number of queries per connection (including low numbers) shows amortisation of setup occurs between 100 or ~2000 q/conn depending on the nameserver      We also note some complimentary related work: High-Performance DNS over TCP by Baptiste Jonglez, University Grenoble Alpes who also presented at RIPE 76: Slides, Video. Key results from this work were:\n Setup: Measured just Unbound nameserver but used thousands of cloud VM clients. Measured just UDP/TCP (not TLS) and used a simple tcpscaler tool where TCP connections were never closed Determined that for Unbound TCP throughput for 25,000 clients was 25% of the UDP throughput and this decreased as the number of clients increased (see graph below) Eventually scaled to 6.5 million clients as a POC    Goals of this work We had always intended to extend our work to tens of thousands of clients and were particularly intrigued by Baptiste\u0026rsquo;s results which showed a poorer TCP through put than we expected and an unexpected drop in throughput between 10 and 10,000 clients. However when we looked at the details of his work it became clear that the above graph was for the case where Unbound was restricted to a single thread (our work above had used 4 threads).\nSo we wanted to explore the performance across the *nameservers for 24,000 clients where the nameserver could effectively use all the resources of our test machine. *\nThis work used the same lab set up as the previous work, except that we used up to 24 separate dnsperf instances running in parallel, each spawning 1000 TCP connections to reach a total of 24,000 clients. In each test 5000 queries per connection were used to ensure the connections cycled during the test but that the handshake setup had been fully amortised. The following work has also been presented at RIPE 77: Slides, Video\nResults - TCP vs UDP In the following graphs blue lines are UDP, reds lines are TCP\n Unbound measurements Our findings are shown below for measuring Unbound using 1 thread and then 32 threads (on a 16 core machine with hyper threading enabled).\n For a single thread we see a similar profile the above graph from High-Performance DNS over TCP by Baptiste Jonglez, however:\n with a slightly lower throughput and less dramatic decline as the number of clients increases and we observe that TCP is 32% of UDP throughput for 24,000 clients.   For 32 threads we see a quite different profile: a significantly higher throughput and TCP is 67% of UDP throughput for 24,000 clients.  We also note is is almost the same for 5000 clients and suspect the decrease above that might be related to IRQ handling.   Conclusion: When Unbound has sufficient resources the performance throughput of TCP is 2/3 of that of UDP even at large numbers of clients.\nKnot Resolver and BIND We repeated the test runs for both Knot Resolver and BIND for many clients - the results are below.\n   Knot Resolver\n TCP is 50% of UDP at 24,000 clients Similar profile and throughput to Unbound    BIND\n TCP is 25% of UDP at 24,000 clients Lower UDP throughput than the other name servers and a strange flat profile for TCP    dnsdist We were unable to scale the number of simultaneous clients that dnsdist would accept over TCP past 1000. The reason for this, we have confirmed with PowerDNS, is due to the fundamental architecture of dnsdist when dealing with TCP connections - the number of simultaneous connections that can be processed is entirely dependent on the size of the thread pool. Increasing this takes system resources, and is not practicable beyond a point dependent on the server hardware.\nConclusion:\nWe have had to conclude that dnsdist is currently optimised for only a moderate number of client connections. We believe recent work in dnsdist is changing this model for the DoH implementation. Results - TLS proxy vs native TLS HA-Proxy fronting Unbound Finally, we also investigated the performance of native nameserver TLS support vs a TLS-TCP proxy/TCP nameserver setup (no \u0026lsquo;traditional\u0026rsquo; TLS proxy that we know of can receive DNS-over-TLS and forward over UDP).\nTo do this we configured Unbound to use 32 threads, and configured HAProxy to use 32 single-threaded processes (the recommended configuration for HAProxy in the TLS-TCP proxy use case). Note that with fewer threads available to HA proxy it appeared that that the encryption/decryption process was the main performance bottleneck.  Performance of the proxy/nameserver combination is slightly below that of the native nameserver - unsurprising given that the proxy introduces an extra connection into the end to end processing chain However the overhead of using a proxy is at worst in the region of 20% of peak throughput.  Adding DNS-over-TLS service to an existing nameserver when native nameserver TLS support is not available is, potentially, a realistic performance option for operators.  Conclusion: These results show that use of a TLS-TCP proxy versus native nameserver TLS support performs as might be expected.\nLimitations of these measurements These measurements use a modified version of dnsperf, a widely used DNS UDP benchmarking tool. UDP benchmarking is rather simplistic and is only concerned with throughput and latency and has the luxury of treating the client population as heterogeneous. Session based benchmarking can’t do this:\n Consider individual client experience (throughput \u0026amp; latency)  Clients behave differently: must simulate client population with varying profiles (qps, idle timeouts)  For example, taking our measurements of Unbound (32 threads) and converting the data to represent the average queries per second per client gives the following graph:\n With 24,000 clients, each client is making ~20 queries per second.  Real DNS traffic data Very little real world data for DNS client populations is available that can describe the behaviour of individual clients. Some recently shared data (courtesy of Bert Hubert at PowerDNS) show how much variation there can be even in a small traffic sample. The following data was collected in in a 7 minute window observing traffic on a recursive resolver. We estimate the number of individual client (addresses) is in the region of 250k.\n It can be easily observed that only a handful of clients are reaching a query rate of 20 q per second, and these are likely to be either forwarding resolvers or many devices behind e.g. a NAT The distribution is smooth apart from 2 peaks, which correspond to 1 query of ~35s and 1 query ever ~5s.  We see a significant number of clients performing only a single query during the measurement window.  It must be noted that this data is from a UDP client population and UDP clients use a different name serve selection algorithm to that specified for session based DNS (RFC7766). So there may be many reasons for the overall distribution including:\n Client resolver choice algorithm  Service provider load balancing  Client software performing periodic network probing  Bursty traffic and device idle behaviour Routers with many devices  Forwarding resolvers  We believe we need to gather real world (anonymised) data from operators of DNS Privacy servers to correctly understand the client profiles of session based DNS to aid with further benchmarking.\n HTTP-like client population modelling? We suggest that further useful work on DNS benchmarking for session based protocols (DoT, DoH or DoQ) would require a new approach. In addition to gathering real world data we believe a new benchmarking tool is required.\nWe have investigated a number of tools designed for HTTP benchmarking that are capable of generating traffic with different percentages of client behaviour - our report is here. However we did not find any that could be easily modified to become useful DNS benchmarking tools. We suggest a new, hybrid tool will be required with a high DNS query throughput but with HTTP tester-like scripting capabilities to model a diverse client populate. We have sketched out some initial requirements for such a tool and are happy to hear feedback on this proposal. "

Only the operators of DNS privacy servers have access to the details of the queries. For operational reasons such as monitoring server performance or detecting and mitigating attacks operators need to keep logs of the DNS queries they see; in some circumstances they may need to share those logs with other operators. To preserve end user privacy, as RFC697317observes it is important that the data in these logs limits the identifiability of end users; more generally, that the data in the logs is kept to the minimum required for purpose, a process the RFC terms data minimisation.\nData minimising a trace or logs of network traffic therefore includes ensuring the recorded data does not contain privacy-sensitive information. This is typically personal data, or data that can be used to link a record to an individual, but may also include revealing other confidential information, for example on the structure of an internal corporate network. In the case of identifiability, this means that if individual user identifiers cannot be omitted altogether, pseudonyms should be used instead.\nThe problem of effectively ensuring that DNS query logs do not contain privacy-sensitive information is not one that currently has a generally agreed solution. This page gives an overview of current approaches to identifier pseudonymisation. As RFC762616makes clear, the big privacy risk in DNS is connecting DNS queries to an individual, so at present the main focus is on pseudonymising client IP addresses (though, of course, the MAC address, VLAN identifier and ARP data may be useful in particularly localised environments).\nTerminology Pseudonymising a dataset is generally done using either anonymisation or pseudonomysation. This discussion uses the definitions from RFC697317 Section 3, with additional observations from van Dijkhuizen et al.1  Anonymisation. To enable anonymity of an individual, there must exist a set of individuals that appear to have the same attribute(s) as the individual. To the attacker or the observer, these individuals must appear indistinguishable from each other.\n  Pseudonymisation. The true identity is deterministically replaced with an alternate identity (a pseudonym). When the pseudonymisation schema is known, the process can be reversed, so the original identity becomes known again.\n  In practice there is a fine line between the two; for example, how to categorise a deterministic algorithm for pseudonymisation of IP addresses that produces a group of pseudonyms for a single given address?\nHistory Awareness of the need for pseudonymising data, so that significant corpuses of captures could be shared for research purposes, sparked research into particularly IP address pseudonymisation in the late 1990s/early 2000s. Several techniques reflecting different requirements for the pseudonymised addresses and different performance/resource tradeoffs emerged over the course of the decade. Developments over the last decade have been both a blessing and a curse; the large increase in size between an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, for example, renders some techniques (in particular TSA) impractical, but also makes available a much larger amount of input entropy. Pseudonymised IPv6 addresses are therefore much better placed to resist brute force re-identification attacks than IPv4 addresses. Several authors (e.g. Brenker \u0026amp; Arnes11) have observed that today any IPv4 address pseudonymisation is vulnerable to a brute force attack, particularly if an attacker is capable of ensuring packets are captured by the target and the attacker can send forged traffic with arbitrary source and destination addresses to the target thus permitting an attack along the lines of a cryptographic chosen plaintext attack.\nCategorising techniques for anonymising logs\nThe ways in which data may be pseudonymised can be classified into some broad categories.\n Replacement. A one-to-one replacement of a field to a new value of the same type, for example using a regular expression. Filtering. Removing (and thus truncating) or replacing data in a field. Field data can be overwritten, often with zeros, either partially (grey marking) or completely (black marking). Generalisation. Data is replaced by more general data with reduced specificity. One example would be to replace all TCP/UDP port numbers with one of two fixed values indicating whether the original port was ephemeral (\u0026gt;=1024) or non-ephemeral (\u0026gt;1024). Another example, precision degredation, reduces the accuracy of e.g. a numeric value or a timestamp. Enumeration. With data from a well-ordered set, replace the first data item data using a random initial value and then allocate ordered values for subsequent data items. When used with timestamp data, this preserves ordering but loses precision and distance. Reordering/shuffling. Preserving the original data, but rearranging its order, often in a random manner. Random substitution. As replacement, but using randomly generated replacement values. Cryptographic permutation. Using a permutation function, such as a hash function or cryptographic block cipher, to generate a replacement de-identified value.  This list is derived from RFC6235 and van Dijkhuizen et al.1A pseudonymising technique may also have properties desirable in a particular application:\n Format-preserving encryption. Normally when encrypting, the original data length and patterns in the data should be hidden from an attacker. Some applications of data minimisation, such as network capture pseudonymisation, require that the pseudonymised data is of the same form as the original data, to allow the data to be parsed in the same way as the original. Prefix preservation. Values such as IP addresses and MAC addresses contain prefix information that can be valuable in analysis, e.g. manufacturer ID in MAC addresses, subnet in IP addresses. Prefix preservation ensures that prefixes are pseudonymised consistently; e.g. if two IP addresses are from the same subnet, prefix preserving pseudonymising will ensure that their pseudonymised counterparts will also share a subnet. Prefix preservation may be fixed (the length of the prefix to be preserved must be set by the user in advance), or general (if two addresses share any length of prefix bits in common, their pseudonymised counterparts will also have the same length of prefix bits in common).  Notable pseudonymising techniques Google Analytics non-prefix filtering Since May 2010, Google Analytics has provided a facility that allows website owners to request that all their users IP addresses are pseudonymised within Google Analytics processing. This very basic pseudonymisation simply sets to zero the least significant 8 bits of IPv4 addresses, and the least significant 80 bits of IPv6 addresses. The level of pseudonymisation this produces is perhaps questionable. There are some analysis results13which suggest that the impact of this on reducing the accuracy of determining the user\u0026rsquo;s location from their IP address is less than might be hoped; the average discrepancy in identification of the user city for UK users is no more than 17%. Anonymisation: Format-preserving, Filtering (grey marking).\ndnswasher Since 2006, PowerDNS have included a data minimisation tool dnswasher14with their PowerDNS product. This is a PCAP filter that performs a one-to-one mapping of end user IP addresses with an pseudonymised address. A table of user IP addresses and their de-identified counterparts is kept; the first IPv4 user addresses is translated to 0.0.0.1, the second to 0.0.0.2 and so on. The de-identified address therefore depends on the order that addresses arrive in the input, and running over a large amount of data the address translation tables can grow to a significant size. Anonymisation: Format-preserving, Enumeration.\nPrefix-preserving map Used in TCPdpriv2, this algorithm stores a set of original and pseudonymised IP address pairs. When a new IP address arrives, it is compared with previous addresses to determine the longest prefix match. The new address is pseudonymised by using the same prefix, with the remainder of the address pseudonymised with a random value. The use of a random value means that TCPdrpiv is not deterministic; different pseudonymised values will be generated on each run. The need to store previous addresses means that TCPdpriv has significant and unbounded memory requirements, and because of the need to allocated pseudonymised addresses sequentially cannot be used in parallel processing. Anonymisation: Format-preserving, prefix preservation (general), replacement, random substitution.\nCryptographic Prefix-Preserving Pseudonymisation Cryptographic prefix-preserving pseudonymisation was originally proposed as an improvement to the prefix-preserving map implemented in TCPdpriv, described in Xu et al3and implemented in the Crypto-PAn tool4. Crypto-PAn is now frequently used as an acronym for the algorithm. Initially it was described for IPv4 addresses only; extension for IPv6 addresses was proposed in Harvan \u0026amp; Schönwälder5and implemented in snmpdump6. This uses a cryptographic algorithm rather than a random value, and thus pseudonymity is determined uniquely by the encryption key, and is deterministic. It requires a separate AES encryption for each output bit, so has a non-trivial calculation overhead. This can be mitigated to some extent (for IPv4, at least) by pre-calculating results for some number of prefix bits. Pseudonymisation: Format-preserving, prefix preservation (general), cryptographic permutation.\nTop-hash Subtree-replicated Anonymisation Proposed in Ramaswamy \u0026amp; Wolf7, Top-hash Subtree-replicated Anonymisation (TSA) originated in response to the requirement for faster processing than Crypto-PAn. It used hashing for the most significant byte of an IPv4 address, and a pre-calculated binary tree structure for the remainder of the address. To save memory space, replication is used within the tree structure, reducing the size of the pre-calculated structures to a few Mb for IPv4 addresses. Address pseudonymisation is done via hash and table lookup, and so requires minimal computation. However, due to the much increased address space for IPv6, TSA is not memory efficient for IPv6. Pseudonymisation: Format-preserving, prefix preservation (general), cryptographic permutation.\nipcipher A recently-released proposal from PowerDNS8, ipcipher is a simple pseudonymisation technique for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. IPv6 addresses are encrypted directly with AES-128 using a key (which may be derived from a passphrase). IPv4 addresses are similarly encrypted, but using a recently proposed (and confusingly closely named) encryption ipcypher9suitable for 32bit block lengths. However, the author of ipcrypt has since indicated10that it has low security, and further analysis has revealed it is vulnerable to attack. At the time of writing, progress on ipcipher appears to have stalled. Pseudonymisation: Format-preserving, cryptographic permutation.\nBloom filters van Rijswijk-Deij et al15have recently described work using Bloom filters to categorise query traffic and record the traffic as the state of multiple filters. By this means, it is possible to determine with a high probability if, for example, a particular query was made, but the set of queries made cannot be recovered from the filter. Similarly, by mixing queries from a sufficient number of users in a single filter, it becomes practically impossible to determine if a particular user performed a particular query. Large numbers of queries can be tracked in a memory-efficient way. As filter status is stored, this approach cannot be used to regenerate traffic, and so cannot be used with tools used to process live traffic. Anonymisation: Generalisation.\nOther data minimisation considerations (A placeholder list).\nTTL/Hoplimit (if present) can be used to fingerprint client OS.\nMAC address/VLAN.\nDNS ID lack of randomisation ditto.\nAll queries down a single TCP stream must come from the same host.\nReferences  Niels van Dijkhuizen and Jeroen van der Ham. 2018.

Note that this file contains both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\nNote also that this file only enables a small subset of the available servers by default. Users can choose to use additional servers by uncommenting the relevant sections in the file. See DNS Privacy Test Servers for details of the available servers.\n Create Custom Configuration File Alternatively the configuration file location can be specified on the command line using the -C flag. Changes to the configuration file require a restart of Stubby.\nFrom release 0.1.3 of stubby (using the 1.2 release of getdns) the configuration file format is a YAML like format, which contains detailed comments of the options. See here for an example or keep reading for a short description. To be backwards compatible a file using the YAML format must have a .yml or .yaml extension. The previously used JSON like format used internally in getdns is still supported but only when the configuration file is specified via the command line using the -C flag. This format is the same as the output returned by stubby -i. For example, this output can be used as a configuration file directly, but a less verbose form is also accepted.\n Essentially the options available are the same as the options that can be set on a getdns context.  Doxygen documentation for the context options is available here.  A detailed description of the context settings is in the API A detailed description of all the extensions than can also be used is also in the API.  To aid with creating a custom configuration file, an example is given below. The config file below will configure Stubby in the following ways:\n resolution_type: Work in stub mode only (not recursive mode) - required for Stubby operation. dns_transport_list: Use TLS only as a transport (no fallback to UDP or TCP). tls_authentication: Use Strict Privacy i.e. require a TLS connection and authentication of the upstream  If Opportunistic mode is desired, remove the tls_authentication: GETDNS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED field and add additional transports to the dns_transport_list (e.g. UDP, TCP) . In Opportunistic mode authentication of the nameserver is not required and fallback to clear text transports is permitted if they are in the dns_transport_list.   tls_query_padding_blocksize: Use the EDNS0 padding option to pad DNS queries to hide their size edns_client_subnet_private: Use EDNS0 Client Subnet privacy so the client subnet is not sent to authoritative servers listen_address: have the Stubbby daemon listen on IPv4 and IPv6 on port 53 on the loopback address idle_timeout: Use an EDNS0 Keepalive idle timeout of 10s unless overridden by the server. This keeps idle TLS connections open to avoid the overhead of opening a new connection for every query. round_robin_upstreams: Round robin queries across all the configured upstream servers. Without this option Stubby will use each upstream server sequentially until it becomes unavailable and then move on to use the next. upstream_recursive_servers: Use the NLnet labs test DNS Privacy Server for outgoing queries. In Strict Privacy mode, at least one of the following is required for each nameserver:  tls_auth_name: This is the authentication domain name that will be verified against the presented certificate. tls_pubkey_pinset: The sha256 SPKI pinset for the server. This is also verified against the presented certificate.    resolution_type: GETDNS_RESOLUTION_STUB dns_transport_list: - GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS tls_authentication: GETDNS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED tls_query_padding_blocksize: 256 edns_client_subnet_private : 1 idle_timeout: 10000 listen_addresses: - 127.0.0.1 - 0::1 round_robin_upstreams: 1 upstream_recursive_servers: - address_data: 185.49.141.38 tls_auth_name: \u0026#34;getdnsapi.net\u0026#34; tls_pubkey_pinset: digest: \u0026#34;sha256\u0026#34; value: foxZRnIh9gZpWnl+zEiKa0EJ2rdCGroMWm02gaxSc9Q= Additional privacy servers can be specified by adding more entries to the upstream_recursive_servers list above (note a separate entry must be made for the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of a given server. More DNS Privacy test servers are listed here.\nA custom port can be specified by adding the tls_port: attribute to the upstream_recursive_server in the config file.\nA custom listen address port can be configured by using the \u0026lt;IP_address\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;port\u0026gt; syntax\nDNSSEC To enable DNSSEC validation when using Stubby add the following option to the configuration file\ndnssec_return_status: GETDNS_EXTENSION_TRUE A trust anchor is also required for DNSSEC validation. getdns version 1.2 and later include support for automatic trust anchor management - which will automatically fetch a trust anchor if none is present on the system. See \u0026lsquo;Zero configuration DNSSEC\u0026rsquo; (and below) for the specific details of key management for DNSSEC for this case. If using a version of getdns earlier than 1.2 then a trust anchor must be manually installed and managed on the system. We recommend using unbound-anchor.\nStorage of Zero-config Trust anchor When the system-level user does have a home directory, stubby will store the for Zero configuration DNSSEC dynamically acquired root trust anchor in a subdirectory called \u0026ldquo;.getdns\u0026rdquo; of that home directory (or in \u0026ldquo;%AppData%\\getdns\u0026rdquo; on Windows). If the system-level user does not have a home directory or the home directory is not writeable or readable, stubby will fallback to the current working directory.\nThis can be overruled by supplying a \u0026ldquo;appdata_dir\u0026rdquo; in the stubby.yml configuration file. When a \u0026ldquo;appdata_dir\u0026rdquo; was specified, that directory will be used for storing data related to Zero configuration DNSSEC immediately, without the other paths being tried. It is recommended for systemd setups using the provided systemd.service file(s) to have a \u0026ldquo;appdata_dir\u0026rdquo; directive set to \u0026ldquo;/var/cache/stubby\u0026rdquo; in the stubby.yml configuration file.\nNote that using DNSSEC can add a small performance overhead because it increases the number of queries required to resolve a DNS request.\nOpportunistic DoT to your local resolver Some users may want to have a configuration for Stubby that will always use the resolver from the system configuration (most likely but not always on the local network), but with encryption used where possible. This is an Opportunistic mode which does not authenticate the DoT server. To configure Stubby in this mode:\n  Set the transport list and authentication parameter in the configuration to:\ndns_transport_list: - GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS - GETDNS_TRANSPORT_UDP - GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TCP tls_authentication: GETDNS_AUTHENTICATION_NONE   Remove (or comment out) all the upstream_resolvers. This will cause Stubby to fallback to using the system resolvers only.\n  Note: a future version of Stubby will most likely support a mixed mode of system resolvers and configured resolvers. Runtime logging In the 0.1.2 release of stubby there is runtime logging, which can be turned on by using the \u0026lsquo;-l\u0026rsquo; flag.\nIn the 0.1.3 release the logging level is be controlled by specifying a logging level via the \u0026lsquo;-v\u0026rsquo; flag. See stubby help (\u0026lsquo;stubby -h\u0026rsquo;) for more details. "

There is active work in this area.\nThere are now multiple implementations (including Stubby a local DNS Privacy stub resolver) and a number of experimental and public servers deployed. DNS-over-HTTP (DoH) RFC8484 specifies DNS-over-HTTPS as a Standards Track protocol on October 2018. There are several implementations (including Firefox) and deployments. Note that with DoH it is possible to intermingle DNS and HTTP traffic on the same port 443 connection and make blocking of encrypted DNS harder. It should be noted that this RFC addresses almost purely protocol issues, there is no dynamic discovery mechanism for DoH specified yet so it cannot be done opportunistically (it must be configured).\nDNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) A draft was submitted in April 2017 to the IETF QUIC Working group on DNS-over-QUIC\nNon Standards Track options DNS-over-DTLS RFC8094 specified DNS-over-DTLS as an Experimental Standard in Feb 2017. To our knowledge that are no implementations of DNS-over-DTLS planned or in progress.\nOne issue with DNS-over-DTLS is that it must still truncate DNS responses if the response size it too large (just as UDP does) and so it cannot be a standalone solution for privacy without a fallback mechanism (such as DNS-over-TLS) also being available.\nDNSCrypt DNSCrypt is a method of authenticating communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver that has been around since 2011.  It prevents DNS spoofing.  It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and haven\u0026rsquo;t been tampered with (the messages are still sent over UDP).  As a side effect it provides increased privacy because the DNS message content is encrypted.  It is an open specification but it has not been standardized by the IETF.  There are multiple implementations and a set of DNSCrypt servers available. OpenDNS offers DNSCrypt   Also check out an in depth comparison from Tenta.\nDNSCurve DNSCurve was developed in 2010 with encrypting the resolver to authoritative communications in mind. It was not standardized by the IETF.\nDNS-over-HTTPS Google offers a proprietary DNS-over-HTTPS service using a JSON format for DNS queries.\n"

Can we get privacy benefit from this\nScott\u0026rsquo;s talk and DKG\u0026rsquo;s talk - there\u0026rsquo;s information leaked above recursive, but Scott asks if it\u0026rsquo;s operationally feasible for the auth operator to do encryption, whereas DKG takes the view that it needs to be\nOpen discussion -\u0026gt;\nDKG asks Scott about the TLS vulnerabilities:\nare they vulnerabilities to the operation or to the cryptographic promise of TLS? Characterize the attack service better for authoritative servers considering deployment\nScott says - we didn\u0026rsquo;t dig deep into this. Different vulns have different risks. This is a place where studies are important.\nBenno - Scott, you did an analysis and a handful of others did - is there an overview of the operational impacts studies? Who should be doing this? Where should this information be shared?\nScott - has some things happening along those lines - we do protocol design in the IETF, but not how it really works. IF we make a mistake in ops for COM, NET, A and J roots, that\u0026rsquo;s very bad. Scott will be talking about this during upcoming DNSSEC Workshop at ICANN. These aren\u0026rsquo;t going to be resolved in the IETF, needs to be where the operators are.\nAllison - there are many types of SLD. My org is talking with our vendors - we have different tradeoffs than a TLD or an infrastructure SLD\nScott - characterized the enterprise domains as smaller or lower risk\nDKG points out that you could safely try at root and TLDs too by having some instances\nJim Reid - don\u0026rsquo;t forget that if enterprise domains are broken, there are also some dire consequences. A lot of ISPs or others will think it\u0026rsquo;s too hard and it will result in more aggregation and consolidation - toss it to Google or another third party\nWes Hardaker - didn\u0026rsquo;t write down this question\u0026hellip;\nPaul Hoffman - just to be clear, from my comments in the main session, I\u0026rsquo;m very hesitant for us to say that \u0026ldquo;in order to get to this place, these people must do something\u0026rdquo; - we should not link privacy decisions to someone doing enough of what\u0026rsquo;s needed. Just don\u0026rsquo;t assume that the resolver operators will do the right thing. Even qname minimization is still dicey and experimental. If we want more privacy, offering many, letting people try it, find out how it works by measuring it. Don\u0026rsquo;t discourage anyone to try what works for their need. We know there are TLDs that care a great deal to be very privacy preserving. He notes that the increase in TCP is a big thing. At root and typical auths, the use of TCP is about 5% and it will go to 50% or higher.\nFrom the Zoom chat:\ndkg to Everyone (3:48 PM)\nfail-open protocol defaults are terrible long-term. but we currently have a open-all-the-time default for recursive-to-authoritative\nPaul Syverson to Everyone (3:48 PM)\nand/or downgrading attacks.\nJim Reid to Everyone (3:49 PM)\n@paul where are the trade-offs documented so informed decisions can be made? if there’s no guidance…\nJim Reid - not compel, but give people good guidance. Where is that to happen?\nPaul Hoffman - we tried to do this in DPRIVE, and it became unreadable to the operators. Ask Benno to comment: for a lot of operators, the best source of information is their vendors.\nBenno - Thank you, Paul\nWes Hardaker - follow-on topic - splitting out secure vs. insecure protocols - we should figure out which operators pehaps split TCP vs UDP. We (ISI) have created some infrastructure with NSF funding, reach out to Wes for help setting up experiments\nBenno - wrapping up, any other last topics\nDKG - I wanted to call out the concerns that Paul Syverson raised about fail-open. We are pretty good now at moving form always-open to fail-open to something that can be locked down. STS is the example. Learn the resource management parts with the opportunistic experiments.\nBenno - three things to wrap up\n need operational guidance for TLD, root, SLDs need for experimentation, not trivial, take up Wes on his group\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure as one part of this - generic, will support DOH, DOT, TLS, traffic patterns to go to lock-down-able  Notes on the three breakouts (when we are back in the plenary)\nMeasurement - Sandra - discussed protocol designs and end-user education as a continuation of the earlier discussion\nCivil Society and Usability - Gurshabad - discussed balkanization - can we make this cost? Also discussed user education, there a priority is not to overload the user with info and making them not fear they will break their Internet\nNovel Work and ADot - continued from session. He shared the three points above.\n"

According to tsung status, anyway. Reviews say it can generate 20-30k VU per machine. Written in Erlang. Has existing plugins for non-HTTP traffic, e.g. LDAP, MySQL server, and support for UDP and TCP/TLS. Can do basic scripting of client behaviour in XML config. Appears possible to script desired behaviour.   Con:  Mailing list is quiet (few messages every other month) and not much commit activity on GitHub. No DNS plugin, and would need to write one. In Erlang.   Conclusion: worth further investigation, see below   k6  Pro:  New. Shiny. Popular on GitHub. Client scripts written in JavaScript, so can produce desired behaviour. Written in Go, so good DNS lib available. Can export results to InfluxDB ready for graphing by Grafana.   Con:  No non-HTTP modules as yet. Does not necessarily seem to scale to large number of VU. I tried running a simple 10s test on jim-dev-linux. Test startup took 2s on 10 VU, 9s on 100 VU, 41s on 500 VU, 63s on 750 VU and 26m9s on 1000 VU. The latter was because it went well into swap on a 4Gb RAM VM.     Conclusion: Prohibitive startup times with 1000 VU    Others surveyed but not tested:  Locust  Pro:  Python. Client is also Python, so can produce desired behaviour. Good at distributed clients. Scales to a lot of clients.   Con:  In Python, so not fast. Max query rates 1/25 competitors on same hardware. Relies on client scaling for volume. Aimed at those willing to spin up a lot of AWS instances.     JMeter  Pro:  DNS howto: https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/dns_test_using_jmeter/ Widely used.   Con:  Reports says maxes out at 1000 VU per machine. Needs 1 Java thread per VU.      Work on Tsung After further work on Tsung we concluded that peak traffic generation for single client instance of 30k clients was limited to 100kqps, as discussed below. This would mean many client VM\u0026rsquo;s would be needed to achieve moderate DNS traffic levels. We suspect the fundamental reason behind this is twofold:\n Each session is scripted, so you can mimic real traffic. But that scripting is at some level interpreted. HTTP testing happens at a lower order of magnitude of connections and traffic than DNS. Hitting a website with 10,000 HTTP GETs down the same connection just doesn\u0026rsquo;t really happen.  We did do some development work on it to add DNS as a proof of concept, the result can be found in the dns-client branch in this GitHub repo. It proved reasonably easy to get a DNS plugin doing synchronous queries working over UDP, TCP and TCP/TLS. Even taking successive lookups from a queries file as used by dnsperf. Our specific observations are:\n Dynamic variable substitution on each query slows down activity significantly, and according to this PR currently can be a serious bottleneck for horizontal scaling. We found that yes, you can create a lot of concurrent sessions (i.e. Virtual Users). However, the total throughput of queries that you can generate falls off markedly; a single session generating 7,000,000 UDP packets that it sends and doesn\u0026rsquo;t check for answers can send 100k packets/sec, but increasing the number of sessions doesn\u0026rsquo;t increase the overall output. Instead you rapidly find total output halving if you add several more sessions, and moving to a lot of sessions reduces total output to more like 7k. No matter what we changed, we\u0026rsquo;ve been unable to get total output much above 100kqps. Adding support for pipelining queries (having multiple queries in flight from a single session, necessary to mimic client behaviour) is not straightforward. The concept just doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in Tsung at present; it\u0026rsquo;s basically synchronous only.  So, the problem is that we\u0026rsquo;re unable to use Tsung to generate baseline performance numbers to compare with existing numbers. While it might (after some work) be useful for real-life type scenarios, there are concerns about how well it will scale horizontally (though that may well be the dynamic variable issue above). The original author does designed for many parallel runs of complex sessions - so, probably good for real life tests, but a problem if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to establish a baseline of maximum queries a server can handle.\n"

Installation The Windows Installer can be obtained from this page Latest windows installers After installing and running we recommend making the Stubby Manager Icon permanently visible in the system tray (select the Start menu and type \u0026lsquo;select which icons appear on the taskbar\u0026rsquo;).\nYou may also want to manually configure the Stubby Manager application to start at login/wake - this can be done\n Manually by creating a desktop short cut for the Stubby Manager application and then copy/pasting it into the %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Start-up directory Installing a scheduled task based on the C:\\Program Files\\Stubby\\StubbyManager.xml file.   Overview Welcome page The \u0026lsquo;Info\u0026rsquo; Tab provides background information and more details on DNS, DNS encryption and getdns/stubby. These details can be hidden to provide a cleaner interface.\nOn/Off button For users who are happy to simply use the defaults provided (including the Stubby maintained resolvers) then simply hit the big button to turn Stubby on! Stubby will then automatically start again if the machine is rebooted. The display shows which networks and which network profiles are in use (see below)\nNetwork Profiles Three profiles are provided for flexible configuration for users who want to customise their setup. Each contains options to set the following:\n Encrypt DNS - Use only TLS as a transport (otherwise UDP, TCP and TLS are all available) Always Authenticate - Only connect to servers that have authentication information and where the TLS handshake can verify that information. Validate data - enable stub mode DNSSEC validation Round Robin - open connections to all the selected servers and send queries in turn to each. Default is to use the selected servers in order unless they become unavailable.   Untrusted This is the default profile provided on install, it encrypted DNS using DNS-over-TLS (DoT) to the Stubby recursive resolvers. It is suitable for use in most networks where DoT is not blocked - note however that the resolvers are based in Europe so users outside Europe may want to choose alternative resolvers for better latency.\nTrusted The trusted profile currently uses the Quad9 resolvers BUT in the beta release will use the network provided resolvers for resolution, attempting to use DoT opportunistically. In effect this means that connections will be encrypted if the network resolver supports DoT, but not (at this point in time) authenticated. If the network resolver does not support DoT, clear text (UDP/TCP on port 53) will be used. Hostile This is appropriate for use in networks with stricter security policies or that attempt to engage in active surveillance of users e.g. by blocking DoT or well known DoH resolvers. In the beta release it will use DoT to the Quad9 resolvers, in a future release it will support fallback to DoH to the Quad9 resolvers. Note that it may be better to use a full VPN on such networks.\nNetworks Users can configure a default profile to be used automatically when joining new networks and also specific profiles to use on specific networks on this tab. Utilities This tab provides more detailed logging and control for troubleshooting or advanced users. Logs The beta release supports displaying the logs from the stubby deamon in this tab, a future release will allow inspection of DNS queries. (Since stubby runs as a daemon, advanced users can use tcpdump or wireshark to inspect their DNS queries listening on local host port 53).\nCode The code is available on github: https://github.com/Sinodun/Stubby_Manager\nBug reports and feature requests Please file issues at: https://github.com/Sinodun/Stubby_Manager/issues\nFuture features Future release will include a probe mode that can be run to determine the connectivity and latency of available resolvers and also some of their basic (measurable) properties such as DNSSEC support. A custom profile and expert mode will also be available to further customise the Stubby configuration.\n"

April 2017  New Internet Draft on DNS in dedicated QUIC Connections and lots of interesting drafts around DNS over HTTP getting discussion Latest 1.1.0 release of getdns includes Stubby! The DNS Privacy team is highlighted in the IETF Hackathon Videos We\u0026rsquo;ll be talking at both the RMLL conference (5th July) and at JCSA in Paris (6th July) about DNS Privacy We are proud to add Salesforce as supporters of the DNS Privacy project!  March 2017  Great work at the IETF 98 Hackathon on DNS Privacy. In particular see Stephane Borztmeyer\u0026rsquo;s blog on his DNS-over-TLS monitoring plug-in. Proceedings from the NDSS DNS Privacy workshop are available here. Thanks to Matthew Ford from ISOC for a great write up of the workshop. We\u0026rsquo;ll be talking at OARC about dnsprivacy.net  February 2017  We are very pleased to announce a new donation from NLnet Foundation to support work on Stubby. Thank you for your generous support!! Preliminary agenda published for NDSS DNS Privacy Workshop (26th Feb, San Diego) DNS Privacy will be a topic at the IETF 98 Hackathon - please come along!  January 2017  Planning under way for the NDSS DNS Privacy workshop on 26th February in San Diego https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dprive-dtls-and-tls-profiles/ has cleared WGLC 1.0.0 release of getdns (which supports DNS-over-TLS) Knot resolver 1.2.0 released with improved DNS-over-TLS support Warren Kumari has provided a Docker container for easy deployment of a DNS-over-TLS server!

Testing of 0.1.5 getdns codebase which implements TCP pipelining. POC implementation of TCP Fast Open in ldns, Unbound and NSD. Patch released to implement STARTTLS in NSD. Released patch to ldns for connection re-use.  September 2014  Continued helping to implement switch to ldns for stub mode in getdns.  Basic support for synchronous API implemented and per query namespaces also supported. (Note DNSSEC stub validation is still done by unbound at this point\u0026hellip;.)   Creating patch for ldns/drill to support connection reuse for TCP. Using this from synchronous stub mode in getdns to demonstrate connection re-use.  Work on TCP related drafts  August 2014  Working on getnds  Added a new test to verify which transport queries are actually sent over Helping to implement the switch to ldns for stub mode Working on support for pipelining of TCP queries    July 2014  Attended IETF 90 in Toronto and gave a demo of sending queries from drill to Unbound using T-DNS Started looking at pipelining multiple queries from drill to Unbound Extending test framework to test multiple scenarios for drill \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Unbound Finished patch to drill to add extra options:  -l will send a single query over TLS -L will send a single query over TLS after negotiating an upgrade using a STARTTLS/CH/TXT query   Finished patch to Unbound to support \u0026lsquo;upgrade_tls\u0026rsquo; configure option. This enables unbound to receive a a STARTTLS/CH/TXT query, send a STARTTLS/CH/TXT response when configured properly, upgrade to SSL and then receive a query over SSL.   June 2014  Started work on Unbound \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; NSD hop Completing implementation in Unbound to get drill \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Unbound hop working  Implemented a patch to drill to support T-DNS for a single DNS query Discussions on the class to be used for the dummy query. The resolver -\u0026gt; authoritative hop might be better implemented with a IN class query. Start work on Unbound - understand current SSL-upstream implementation From Willem: LDNS does not have support for asynchronous operation so in the short term it will probably be used in getdns just in synchronous mode so that the implementation of TDNS can continue.  Further work on test framework  May 2014  Current getdns stub implementation cannot support sending of CH class queries as it uses libunbound which denies the query and never sends it onwards. Discussed in getnds meeting 19th May that further implementation of T-DNS in getdns will have to wait until libunbound is replaced with ldns for the stub mode. Current understanding is that Willem is going to tackle this in the next few weeks.  Identified need to support CH class in getdns for dummy STARTTLS query. Start on implementation of this.  This implementation highlighted the need for getdns to gracefully handle refused queries that have no associated data.   Created test harness to create a dummy STARTTLS query Agreed that initial implementations will use the dummy CH class query (not the TO bit) Forked getdns. Familiarisation with getdns code base - get it to install and run! Kick off meetings with T-DNS and getdns teams Creation of project issue tracker and wiki site Reading of relevant drafts and documentation - capture any early technical questions  "

	"description": "",
	"content": "How to use a TLS proxy with a DNS nameserver It is of course possible to configure a TLS proxy in front of a DNS nameserver to provide DNS-over-TLS. Example configurations for nginx and haproxy are given here.\nA more comprehensive setup guide using Docker has been provided by Warren Kumari: dprive-nginx-bind (Thanks Warren!)\n Limitations One of the limitations of using a proxy is that without additional work this will normally mean that the client address is not visible to the nameserver, which can cause issues with NAT64, RRL, RPZ etc. There are ways round this using address re-write rules but we don\u0026rsquo;t detail that here. In future a solution like https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bellis-dnsop-xpf/ might become standard. Nameserver config To use the following with BIND to offer a TLS service, configure BIND based on the following named.conf snippet\n This assumes BIND 9.12 which supports response padding (comment that line out if you are using an earlier version) The rncd and logging config is used to capture traffic volume stats - statistics can be dumped periodically with the \u0026lsquo;rndc stats\u0026rsquo; command  options { directory \u0026quot;/home/sinodun\u0026quot;; listen-on port 9999 { 127.0.0.1; }; allow-query { 127.0.0.1; }; tcp-clients 4000; statistics-file \u0026quot;/tmp/bind-stats\u0026quot;; dnssec-enable yes; dnssec-validation auto; response-padding { any; } block-size 468; }; Use with the following in named.conf, adjusting the allow list as needed:\nkey \u0026quot;rndc-key\u0026quot; { algorithm hmac-md5; secret \u0026quot;BIGSECRET\u0026quot;; }; controls { inet 127.0.0.1 port 9953 allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { \u0026quot;rndc-key\u0026quot;; }; }; logging { category default { null; }; category unmatched { null; }; }; nginx.conf user www-data; worker_processes auto; pid /run/nginx.pid; events { worker_connections 1024; # multi_accept on; } stream { upstream dns_tcp_servers { server 127.0.0.1:9999; } server { listen 853 ssl; proxy_pass dns_tcp_servers; ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/lego/certificates/\u0026lt;cert\u0026gt;.crt; ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/lego/certificates/\u0026lt;cert\u0026gt;.key; ssl_protocols TLSv1.2; ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384; ssl_session_tickets on; ssl_session_timeout 4h; ssl_handshake_timeout 30s; } } haproxy.cfg global log /dev/log local0 chroot /var/lib/haproxy user haproxy group haproxy maxconn 1024 pidfile /var/run/haproxy.pid nbproc \u0026lt;processes\u0026gt; tune.ssl.default-dh-param 2048 ssl-default-bind-ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 ssl-default-bind-options force-tlsv12 # Default SSL material locations ca-base /etc/ssl/certs crt-base /etc/ssl/private defaults balance roundrobin timeout http-request 10s timeout queue 1m timeout connect 10s timeout client 1m timeout server 1m timeout check 10s listen dns bind 145.100.185.15:853 ssl crt /etc/haproxy/lego/certificates/\u0026lt;cert\u0026gt;.pem mode tcp server server1 127.0.0.1:9999 For all but lightly loaded systems, you will need to tune the number of processes or threads available to HAProxy. Unlike the nginx configuration above, which specifies an automatic configuration of the number of worker processes, HAProxy needs to have these quantities set by hand. The simplest way is to set configuration item nbproc to an appropriate number; we suggest the number of threads or processes used by the nameserver. For more advanced tuning options, including setting CPU affinity, see the HAProxy documentation or this blog post.\nIf you use HAProxy and have generated your certificates from Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt then you need to combine the certificate chain and key into one file using a command similar to:\ncat /etc/letsencrypt/certs/000\u0026lt;N\u0026gt;_chain.pem /etc/letsencrypt/keys/\u0026lt;my_key\u0026gt;.key \u0026gt; /etc/letsencrypt/certs/\u0026lt;cert\u0026gt;.pem "

	"content": "** THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED. WORK ON A NEWER STUBBY MANAGER GUI IS IN PROGRESS, SEE Stubby Manager GUI ** An installer package for an alpha release of the StubbyManager GUI App is now available:\nThis is the 0.2.6 of the prototype Stubby GUI. It is still very much a work in progress and has only very basic functionality! It is being released at this stage to gain feedback and review from users. We welcome early testing of this application.\nStubbyManager.pkg\nSHA256 Checksum: 0b9de130ac55e02928a21f334ac5c481b092e6535445a402caa7bb165b0b3dba\nThis will overwrite any existing installation so if you have customised your Stubby configuration (either using the \u0026lsquo;Advanced\u0026rsquo; button or by directly editing the stubby.yml file then make a backup before installing!\n This version is built with  getdns version: 1.5.2 openssl version: 1.1.1b stubby version: 0.2.6  It has only been tested on Sierra and High Sierra.\nUsing the GUI When the App is first opened for the very first time, Stubby is not running at this point. It is helpful at this point to monitor the logs while first setting Stubby up - click the View the log\u0026hellip; button.\nYou will be asked at various times to authorise Stubby with your password - this is needed periodically when changing the setup and configuration.\n Starting the Stubby service Use the buttons in the top section of the dialog to:\n Start the Stubby service. At this point the service is running but the system is not sending queries to Stubby. Test the service. This performs a single query to the Stubby service to make sure it is working. If this works then move on to the next step  Using Stubby for DNS queries Check the box that says *Use Stubby DNS and then click Apply. *From this point the system will be using Stubby for all DNS queries, you should start seeing connections opening and closing in the log window as Stubby uses the default servers. With the default configuration (Strict mode) you will see the Stubby Icon in the menu bar change from greyed out to active when you make this change. It therefore indicates that all DNS queries are encrypted. If the configuration is changed to Opportunistic (see below) the icon remains greyed out since some or all queries could be sent in clear text. This will be improved in the next release to better indicate Strict vs Opportunistic mode. Currently the icon is only visible when the App is running (again, to be fixed). Note that Stubby continues to run whilst the App is closed.\nStopping Stubby Stop stop using Stubby, simply click on the Stop button at the top of the dialog. This stops the stubby service and returns the DNS settings to their defaults.\nYou can also restart the service using the Restart button if the logs indicate there is some sort of problem.\nEditing the configuration Users may want to modify the settings by changing the servers or switching to Opportunistic mode (Strict is the default). To do this click the Advanced\u0026hellip; button. This is currently just a text editor view of the stubby.yml configuration file (this will evolve to be more user friendly in future!). A syntax check is performed on the file before it is saved, a more detailed report of syntax problems is also planned.\nFor details on the contents of the file see this page Configuring Stubby.\nAfter updating the configuration the changes must be applied by clicking the Apply button!\n Revert to default If you run into problems changing the configuration (for example the window reports the configuration is not valid), Stubby can be reverted to use the default configuration by:\n clicking the Revert to default button clicking Apply  Known Issues   Stubby sometimes gives false alerts that there is a problem with the service when laptops wake from sleep.\n  Occasionally Stubby gets confused and cannot start or stop the service. A workaround for this is to close StubbyManger and then run the following from a terminal\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.getdns.stubby.plist and relaunch StubbyManager app. (You may have to wait 10 minutes until the existing authorization token has expired).\n  A standard macOS certificate store is provided in the App directory, so any certificates added locally will not be available to Stubby.\n  Code StubbyManager is written in Qt. If you are interested in contributing the code is available here: https://github.com/Sinodun/stubby_manager_gui\n"

	"content": "This page contains some details on how to renew certificates with Let\u0026rsquo;s Encryptusing the same key, which is very helpful in supporting authentication via a SPKI pinset.\n Generating a Key and Manual Renewal Automated renewal Generating a SPKI for your certificate    Many of the current experimental servers are using Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt certificates. Using cerbot makes creating an managing certificates easy.\nAs of recently cerbot no longer checks if the certificate is about to expire, but simple gets a new one. Beware when testing since with Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt there is a limit of 5 certificates per day\u0026hellip;.\n Generating a Key and Manual Renewal This assumes that you will use certbot in conjunction with Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt and you have an existing key \u0026lt;my_key_file\u0026gt; that was use to sign the previous certificate (or you are generating your first certificate).\n  Create your new CSR from your existing private key using \u0026lsquo;openssl req\u0026rsquo;\nopenssl req -key \u0026lt;my_key_file\u0026gt; -new -out \u0026lt;my_csr_file\u0026gt;   Use the certbot interface to renew the cert using the same key, for example using web authenticaiton certbot certonly -d \u0026lt;my_authentication_name\u0026gt; --csr \u0026lt;my_csr_file\u0026gt; --webroot -w /home/website/public or using dns challenge\ncertbot certonly -d \u0026lt;my_authentication_name\u0026gt; --csr \u0026lt;my_csr_file\u0026gt; --preferred-challenges dns --manual   For the dns challenge mode, step 2 outputs a TXT file that must be added to the corresponding zone \u0026lt;my_authentication_name\u0026gt; before the certificate can be issued and instructs something like:\nPlease deploy a DNS TXT record under the name _acme-challenge.\u0026lt;my_authentication_domain_name\u0026gt; with the following value: \u0026lt;TXT value\u0026gt; Once this is deployed, Press ENTER to continue   Manually add the TXT record and wait until it has propagated e.g. use dig to 8.8.8.8 to obtain the new TXT record.   hit ENTER, which should result in a new certificate being issued.   Restart the nameserver or proxy to have it use the new certification.\n    Automated renewal There are a number of ways to do this but one common one is to use https://dehydrated.de/ It is nice for automating the renewal workflow, particularly if you want to use the DNS challenge method, rather than web access. We have two examples of this method:\n Method 1 - based on the workflow at Sinodun and using Knot resolver to sign the DNS zone used for the dns-01 challenge. Method 2 - based on the workflow at NLnet Labs using OpenDNSSEC to sign the DNS zone used for the dns-01 challenge.  Generating a SPKI for your certificate Once you have the certificate configured on your server you can generate the SPKI pin if you want to publish this (so clients can configure this for authenticating your server).\n GnuTLS: gnutls-cli --print-cert -p 853 \u0026lt;IP_address\u0026gt; The pin for each certificate is displayed at the end of the output line beginning ' Certificate[0] info:'\n OpenSSL: echo | openssl s_client -connect \u0026#39;[2001:67c:27e4::35]:853\u0026#39; 2\u0026gt;/dev/null \\  | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | \\  openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64  Or use this handy website https://report-uri.io/home/pubkey_hash  "

Version 0.4.0-a1  The msi and zip files now includes an alpha release of Stubby Manager GUI see this page for details. This installs alongside the existing install and should not interfere with existing installs. (Chocolatey package does not contain this yet.) The alpha is not feature complete and should be used with care, see Stubby Manager GUI. Stubby can now be installed as a Windows service, see this README.md for details.  Version 0.3.0  Update to use Stubby 0.3.0. This release is built with the Visual Studio toolchain. Previous releases were built with MinGW.  Version 0.2.6  Update to use Stubby 0.2.6  Version 0.2.5   Previous versions of the installer were numbered 0.0.1 to 0.0.7. From this release onward we are adopting a new policy. Installer releases will have a 4 component version a.b.c.d. a.b.c gives the Stubby version. d indicates the installer package revision, starting at 0 for the first packaging of a given Stubby version.\n  The 0.2.5.0 release now provides a 32bit install as well as a 64bit install.\n On a 64bit Windows installation, a 32bit install will place files in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Stubby. All other installs place files in C:\\Program Files\\Stubby.    This release corrects the default configuration file location to C:\\Program Files\\Stubby\\stubby.yml. This path no longer needs to be specified on the command line.\n  stubby.bat has been updated to look for the configuration file in the same directory as the Stubby executable.\n  Installer contents These contain the following files by the installer.\nThe 0.3.0.6 release and later provides a 32bit install as well as a 64bit install. On a 64bit Windows installation, a 32bit install will place files in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Stubby. All other installs place files in C:\\Program Files\\Stubby.\n README.txt - containing these instructions stubby.exe - binary stubby.yml - configuration file getdns_query.exe - tool for testing stubby getdns_server_mon.exe - tool for probing servers Powershell scripts for modifying system resolvers:  stubby_setdns_windows.ps1 stubby_resetdns_windows.ps1 Windows 7 versions of Powershell scripts (see below)  stubby_setdns_windows7.ps1 stubby_resetdns_windows7.ps1     Scripts to enable Stubby to be configured as a Scheduled Task  stubby.xml stubby.bat   Additional files required for the Stubby Manager GUI  Configuration It is recommended to use the default configuration file provided which will use \u0026lsquo;Strict\u0026rsquo; privacy mode and spread the DNS queries among several of the current DNS Privacy test servers. Note that this file contains both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. It installed in \u0026ldquo;C:\\Program Files\\Stubby\\stubby.yml\u0026rdquo;\nMore information on how to customise the configuration can be found here.\nRun Stubby Simply invoke Stubby on the command line from a command prompt window (To get a command prompt go to the Windows search box and type \u0026lsquo;cmd\u0026rsquo; and then choose the \u0026lsquo;Command prompt\u0026rsquo; option)\n        \u0026gt; \u0026quot;C:\\Program Files\\Stubby\\stubby.exe\u0026quot; -l    The -l flag enables full logging. Alternatively a specific logging level can be controlled by using the -v flag (run '\u0026quot;C:\\Program Files\\Stubby\\stubby.exe\u0026quot; - h' for details of available levels).\nWe are working on support for running Stubby as a service on Windows 10. Instructions for setting up a Scheduled task are below.\nTest Stubby A quick test can be done by opening a separate Command prompt window and using getdns_query (or your favourite DNS tool) on the loopback address:\n        \u0026gt; \u0026quot;C:\\Program Files\\Stubby\\getdns_query\u0026quot; -s @127``.0.``0.1 www.example.com    You should see a status of GETDNS_RESPSTATUS_GOOD and and rcode of GETDNS_RCODE_NOERROR in the getdns_query output. You should also see a connection being made in the stubby logs.\nModify your upstream resolvers Once this change is made all your DNS queries will be re-directed to Stubby and sent over TLS! (You may need to restart some applications to have them pick up the network settings).\nFor Stubby to re-send outgoing DNS queries over TLS the recursive resolvers configured on your machine must be changed to send all the local queries to the loopback interface on which Stubby is listening.\nIn most cases your system will use the \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; DNS servers that are provided by whatever network you are on at the time. Using the two Powershell comands will be all you need to switch back and forth from Stubby to the default DNS settings for the network you are on. (The scripts don\u0026rsquo;t store any DNS config information because it can change dynamically). If you want to double check what servers you are using right now you can use then follow the instructions below to inspect your system settings. If you have reason to think your system uses specific servers on all networks it might be useful to note your existing default nameservers before making this change so you can use the same instructions to reset them!\nTo set your nameservers to use Stubby\n  From Windows search box type \u0026lsquo;cmd\u0026rsquo; and on the \u0026lsquo;Command prompt\u0026rsquo; option that appears right click and select \u0026lsquo;run as Administrator\u0026rsquo;\n  In the command prompt window that appears type the following to switch the system DNS resolvers to use Stubby.\n        PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy bypass -``file \u0026quot;C:\\Program Files\\Stubby\\stubby_setdns_windows.ps1\u0026quot;      You can monitor the DNS traffic using Wireshark watching on port 853.\nIf you encounter problems or want to turn Stubby off for any reason then reverse this change to restore the default network settings (no DNS Privacy) by running\n        PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy bypass -``file \u0026quot;C:\\Program Files\\Stubby\\stubby_resetdns_windows.ps1    Modify your upstream resolvers (Windows 7) Follow the procedure above, but use the scripts:\n C:\\Program Files\\Stubby\\stubby_setdns_windows7.ps1 and C:\\Program Files\\Stubby\\stubby_resetdns_windows7.ps1  WARNING: These scripts can only update DNS servers on the IPv4 service. IPv6 will still use the default DNS servers, sending queries in clear text so one option is to disable IPv6, the other is to manually update the IPv6 addessses (see below).\n Install Stubby as Windows service See this README.md for details.\nCreate a Scheduled Task If you want Stubby to always start when you boot your system, you can create a Scheduled task for this. A template for the task is provided.\nTo create the task just run\nschtasks /create /tn Stubby /XML \u0026quot;C:\\Program Files\\Stubby\\stubby.xml\u0026quot; /RU \u0026lt;you_user_name\u0026gt; Known Issues  We are aware of occasional issues when Windows sleeps and resumes when stubby must be restarted to work correctly.  If you get an error when trying to run Stubby that includes the words \u0026ldquo;Could not bind on given address\u0026rdquo; then retry the command from an \u0026lsquo;Administrator\u0026rsquo; Command prompt window The \u0026lsquo;-h\u0026rsquo; output of stubby.exe shows the wrong path for the installed configuration file. An issue has been opened for this. The installer currently overwrites the stubby.yml file so if changes have been made a backup should be created before upgrading  Manual update of system revolvers on Windows If you need to manually inspect or change your system revolvers on Windows through the GUI then do the following:\n Open the Control Panel Choose \u0026lsquo;Network and Internet\u0026rsquo; Choose \u0026lsquo;View network status and tasks\u0026rsquo; under \u0026lsquo;Network and Sharing Center\u0026rsquo;  Choose \u0026lsquo;Change adapter settings\u0026rsquo; from the left hand menu Then choose your interface - most likely either \u0026lsquo;Wi-fi\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Ethernet\u0026rsquo; In the dialog that appears, click on the \u0026lsquo;Properties\u0026rsquo; button at the bottom In the list that appears double click on \u0026lsquo;Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\u0026rsquo;  You can toggle your DNS between using the default DNS servers provided by the network you are on and setting specific servers using the botton radio buttons on this page Be sure to press OK and then Close to apply the settings.    Repeat step 7 for \u0026lsquo;Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)\u0026rsquo; if you have IPv6 enabled  Opportunistic mode If you have changed the default config in the stubby.yml file and are running in Opportunistic mode then you may want to add an alternative DNS server in here for robustness. However DNS queries sent to this server will be sent clear text over UDP/TCP, so this is NOT recommended for Strict mode unless required for bootstrapping (e.g. in a corporate network).\n"

The 1.13.1 release can re-use upstream connections. An example minimal config is given below.\nNOTE:\n This uses Cloudflare for simplicity and testing purposes, modify this to the resolver of your choice from e.g. the stubby config file!

Bromite aims at providing a no-clutter browsing experience without privacy-invasive features and with the addition of a fast ad-blocking engine.\u0026rdquo; Note that at the moment Bromite is only for Android, it currently does not provide builds for desktop. In release 67.0.3396.88 Bromite has enabled the underlying DoH implementation in Chromium by exposing configuration options (via chrome://flags). Today the choice is either Google or Cloudflare DoH servers but it is up to the user to choose: https://github.com/bromite/bromite/wiki/Enabling-DNS-over-HTTPS   Chrome   Chrome has a full DoH implementation but the configuration for it is not exposed.

Stubby encrypts DNS queries sent from a client machine (desktop or laptop) to a DNS Privacy resolver increasing end user privacy.\n Stubby is developed under the getdns project, has it\u0026rsquo;s own github repo and issue tracker but dnsprivacy.org currently hosts the online documentation for Stubby. For more background and FAQ see our About Stubby page.\n The command line version of Stubby is suitable for technical/advanced users. Work on more a user friendly GUI called Stubby Manager is underway - see below! Why Use Stubby?\nRead about the problem with DNS Privacy and how Stubby helps\nKey Features  Runs as a daemon listening on the loopback addresses (127.0.0.1, ::0)  Sends all outgoing DNS queries received on those addresses out over TLS Uses a default configuration which provides Strict Privacy and uses a subset of the available DNS Privacy servers Has additional servers available for activation in the configuration file (e.g. Cloudflare, Quad9)  Stubby uses getdns, it is recommended to use at least the 1.6 release of getdns, and preferably the latest getdns stable release.\nA future release of Stubby is expected to support the following:\n DNS-over-HTTPS (DOH) Configuration of servers using authentication name only  Source Code As of August 2017 Stubby has moved to its own repository and getdns is a library dependancy!\nSource code is available on github: https://github.com/getdnsapi/stubby\nLastest release See the Stubby github repo for the latest release tarball or the getdns releases page.\nInstallation Packages Various packages are available, see repology for Stubby. Note1: A debian package is also available but doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up in the above because the version number is currently incorrect (it picks up the getdns version, not the stubby version). Working to fix this!\nNote2: The chocolatey package called \u0026lsquo;stubby\u0026rsquo; as of March 2019 is for Stubby - the name was previously used for a package named stubby4net but that has now been renamed to stubby4net.\nInstallation Guides  Linux  Build from source Running a service Great tutorial on using stubby on Ubuntu desktop - thanks linuxbabe.com!   macOS  Homebrew Stubby Manager GUI (prototype) for macOS (note, this project is no longer maintained. Support for macOS in the new Stubby Manager GUI is a work in progress).

This does not share any code with Stubby but we applaud Android for this development!\nConfiguration See our Stubby configuration guide.\nNote that some users use Stubby in combination wtih Unbound - Unbound provides a local cache and Stubby manages the upstream TLS connections (since Unbound cannot yet re-use TCP/TLS connections).

The nameserver will see only TCP connections which were historically used just for one-shot TCP and may not be robust to many long-lived connections.\n(2) Therefore this will work much better if the nameserver has robust TCP capabilities (as described in Sections 6.2.2 and 10 of RFC7766), and would be required for production level service.

Test your DoT server Monitor your DoT server Benchmarking of DoT    Contributing to the project We welcome and are keen to support anyone who would like to run an open DNS Privacy Server and make the server details available to the DNS Privacy project. For an overview of why DNS Privacy is important, please see DNS Privacy - The Problem. The current list of servers is available here DNS Privacy Test Servers and DNS Public Resolvers.\nWhile there are now several large organisations offering DNS Privacy services we encourage operators to run their on DNS Privacy servers to provide user choice. We recommend reading the Internet Draft on Best Current Practices for DNS Privacy Operators in order to try to provide a good, secure and private service for users. The document is a work in progress - feedback and comments welcome!\nWe are also very keen to increase the number and geographical distribution of the available servers to better serve the global population of users for whom DNS Privacy is important. Most of the servers are currently based in Europe (a few in North America, a few elsewhere) which means users in other parts of the world may be blocked from accessing them but are also likely to experience poor performance (high latency) for DNS queries. We see a particular need for DNS Privacy servers in areas such as the Middle East, Africa and Asia to enable activists and journalist local access to DNS Privacy services.\nPick your software See the Implementations page to see what features are currently supported in the various open source nameserver implementations.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t forget that you can also run a TLS-proxy in front of any nameserver to offer DoT (and there is a Docker image for doing this with BIND). We\u0026rsquo;ve also added a description of how to build HAProxy with TLS 1.3 support.  Also see the video and slides of the great talk given by Colin Petrie at RIPE76 of his analysis of current software and experience of setting up DNS-over-TLS.\n DoT Nameserver Configuration Example configurations can be found on this site for DNS-over-TLS\n Running a TLS Proxy Unbound Knot resolver How to setup dnsdist for DoT  DoH Nameserver Configuration One good reference for available DoH implementations is https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS\n How to setup dnsdist for DoH How to set up a DNSCrypt server  Read up on Best Current practices A best current practice document for DNS privacy operators is under development, see BCP for DNS privacy operators for more details.\nDoes my DoT server need a X.509 certificate? In order to allow users to authenticate the server (for \u0026lsquo;Strict\u0026rsquo; mode) the server needs to be configured with a X.509 certificate. This is optional but recommended.\n Many of the existing servers use the great service at Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt to obtain certificates. See our how-to guide on using Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt.  If you do this then it is helpful to also provide the pinset for the certificate (the SHA-256 fingerprint of the public key) as an alternative validation mechanism. See how to generate an SPKI pinset from a certificate. If you do this then it is also recommended to  Use the same key(s) when renewing the certificate to avoid having to manage key rollovers see:  Short guide on Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt Key renewal. This includes guides to automating renewal.   Provide 2 keys to enable key roll should you need to roll your keys    Note that If you run a server which offers more than one certificate (e.g. via a proxy which uses SNI to route traffic) be aware that SPKI only authentication of the upstream can be limited. Because no SNI is provided when the client is performing SPKI only authentication it is limited to working (by many TLS library client implementations) for only the first certificate returned.\n Test your DoT server If you want to test connectivity to your nameserver from an external source you can use the getdns query webpage:\n Enter a domain name to query for in the top box Check the \u0026lsquo;return_call_reporting\u0026rsquo; in the Extensions box Select \u0026lsquo;TLS\u0026rsquo; as the transport in the Transport box and enter the IP address and optionally the Authentication domain name for your server  Hit Query The output will contain a section at the top called \u0026lsquo;call_reporting\u0026rsquo; which include the following fields   \u0026ldquo;transport\u0026rdquo;: GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS to confirm the query worked over TLS\n  tls_auth_status\u0026quot;: \u0026lt;bindata of \u0026ldquo;Success\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt; if the certificate was successfully authenticated\n  \u0026ldquo;run_time/ms\u0026rdquo;: 215 response time from the query server which is based in the Netherlands\n    You can also use various command line tools:\n the getdns_query command line tool available as part of getdns or stubby kdig tool available with Knot resolver   Monitor your DoT server Stephane Bortzmeyer has written a basic Nagios plugin to monitor DNS-over-TLS servers using getdns which is available in github. We use it to provide a dashboard of the available Privacy servers. Benchmarking of DoT A fork of dnsperf now exists that supports TCP and TLS .\n"
